  Here is an old "todo" text about this topic:

  specifically, we need references (and a mechanics to keep them up-to-date
  in both directions!) for the following notion: we may want to give
  guided tours and explanations of short-cuts as a separate track of
  text in the book, apart from the dialogues.  This could be as
  preface, appendices, and comments at the end of each chapter
