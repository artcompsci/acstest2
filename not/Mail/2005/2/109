Yes, that is a GREAT idea ! ! !

I can appreciate how GREAT that idea is, because I have spent much
time this weekend chasing subtle differences between runs with
slightly different definitions of slightly different things, which
has been very ennoying.  Such automatization should at least make
trouble shooting MUCH easier!

This would be WONDERFUL!
