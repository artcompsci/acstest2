Okay, that's fine.  Perhaps we can start with a single big file, on
the browser at least, so that we keep all the information together;
of course we can enter the information from BUGS/200x/x structure,
as you mentioned.

Sorry, what do you mea with "move"?  Copy them and delete them after
they are done, or copy them to lab notes to remind ourselves what
still needs to be done, or something else?
