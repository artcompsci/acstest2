Hi Piet,

Ya. I added that. Currently, acsdoc.rb will automatically create files
for all methods, with name .foo.rb+bar, where foo.rb is the original
filename and bar is the name of the method. So you can include it by
 : inccode: .foo.rb+bar
I changed "-", which I used for segment stuff, to "+", so that we can
use the same name for segments and methods.

The code I wrote assumes that the source is correctly indented. So if
"def" and matching "end" are not in the same column, it would show
error or strange output...
