I first tried:

  <kamuy|/home/piet/acs/kali/vol/code_management> make all
  make: *** No rule to make target `.acsdocinitrc', needed by `doc'.  Stop.

So then I copied that file (using svn) and then it worked better:

  <kamuy|code_management> svn cp ../vol-1a/.acsdocinitrc .
  A         .acsdocinitrc
  <kamuy|code_management> make all
  ruby ../../../src/coherent_programming/acsdoc.rb --reuseoutput  memo.ok *.rb
  Loading initialization file .acsdocinitrc
  Common initialization file loaded from etc/acsdocinitrc
  reuse flag set
  rdoc    ./.memo.ok check_and_install.rb 
  
  . . . .
  
  code_management.dvi -> code_management.pdf
  [1][2]
  47353 bytes written
  ruby -S check_and_install.rb ACSSCRIPTS check_and_install.rb acsstart.cshrc
  ./check_and_install.rb:35: ./check_and_install.rb:Env var ACSSCRIPTS not defined (RuntimeError)
  make: *** [scripts] Error 1
  
So then I tried to follow your advice:

This I did, by adding to my .cshrc file the line

  source $ACSROOT/bin/acsstart.cshrc

but then there was the following problem

  <kamuy|code_management> source .cshrc
  .cshrc: No such file or directory.
  <kamuy|code_management> source ~/.cshrc
  ACSSCRIPTS: Undefined variable.

Hmmm.  Can you tell me what I should do next?
