Okay.  Logically speaking, I think we should make it a new volume.
I'm not sure whether it will grow to more than 40 or 50 pages, but
we can see what happens once I start writing it up.

Now there are various ways we can embed this volume into our series.

One option would be to put it after volume 4, as volume 5, and
so to rename all further volumes (current 5, 6, . . . will then
become 6, 7, . . . .  yare yare ).  It's quite a bit of work to
rename things, but if that really seems to be the right thing 
to do, I will do it.

I'm wondering, though, whether we are on the right track, with the
way we are grouping our writing in volumes.  I have now rearranged
our volumes so many times, since we got started (less than a year
ago, hard to believe).  This fact in itself could be a sign that
there is something wrong with our approach to number and grouping.

For example, is volume 0b now really in the right place?  Is it
really part of our `vision', the way volume 0 is?  Is it not more
part of the `tool' series, like data format, user interface, etc.?
The answer, of course is: yes, you can look at acsdoc as a tool,
like the other tools, but also it is a type of metatool, on a
different level than the other tools.  So there are equally good
arguments to group it with tools as to give it a separate place.
Even so, I begin to think that 0b is _not_ the right place;
something like `other 0' (00? i? -0?) would be more appropriate
than just 0b.

Another question is: perhaps we are getting to the point of needing
a layer of grouping in between Kali and volumes.  A volume contains
10 chapters, typically, and a chapter contains 5 or so sections.
In general grouping things into 5 to 10 subthings seems to work
best for the human mind, to keep track.  So a good grouping would
now be:

I. Exploratory Phase: 6 volumes 0a, 0b, 1a, 1b, 1c, 2
II. Technical Foundations: 5 volumes 3a, 3b, 4, 5, new-5 (code_management)
III. A Minimal Lab: 7 volumes 6a, 6b, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10
IV. Local Treatments: volumes 12a, 12b, . . .

Perhaps the first step would be to add this level of grouping, and
then to number volumes relative to that level: volume 3a could
become volume II.1 or II.1a, for example.

As for an implementation, all this would suggest that the _real_
implementation is in terms of a logical name, such as "plummer"
or "code_management".  Each volume probably should live under svn
using that name, and that name should _never_ change, once we have
chosen it.  There is no need for it to change, since it will also
_never_ be visible to a user.  All very Ruby-like, this type of
redirection.  You have suggested something like that earlier, aso
you reminded me, and I should have listened to you earlier!  Oh,
well, I am learning (by getting very tired of renumbering volumes ;>).

Now, once we have each volume under svn with logical names, our hands
will be free to rearrange the presentation in many ways, and we can
even have parallel presentations, as we discussed a long time ago: we
can have one or more linear and/or hierarchical series, and we can
have one or more `zoos' with `guided tours', with the basic plan
there perhaps in the same way that a Japanese city is ordered,
in ku and chou, etc.

The more I think about it, this seems to be the _only_ solution.

I could start doing this type of (final??) renaming of volumes
under svn, giving every current volume a new logical name.

ONE QUESTION: should the current vol.1a and vol.1b, etc., each
get a different logical name, or should we name them together
with the same name?

AHA!!  This makes clear the following fact.  There IS ALREADY
an extra level between Kali and Volumes, namely the a,b,...
refinement.

So the fourth section of the second chapter of the first volume
on command-line arguments currently lives within Kali in the
following hierarchy, using "II" for "Technical Foundations":
Kali > II > 3 > a > 2 > 4.

We have decided a while ago to let every volume have the option
to grow into a,b,... and probably most volumes will: the current
13 volumes 0 through 12 already have 20 volumes in total through
the a,b,... extensions.

Coming back to the ONE QUESTION above: if we don't worry about
length, with the 100 to 120 page cutoff of the current volume
size, perhaps the a,b,... distinction would disappear, and that
would argue for using the same logical name.
On the other hand, something like volume 1c is quite different
from 1a and 1b.  In 1a we start with Ruby; in 1b with various
integrators; and 1c will become what I started to write with
Douglas, background and overview of Runge-Kutta.
Hmmmmm.  Perhaps there is not much reason to call those three
all 1, since they are all_quite_ different.  Perhaps each one
SHOULD have a different logical name.
But . . . volume 3b is more a straight extension of volume 3a:
both are on command line arguments . . . although . . . in 3b
I report feedback from applications while 3a is just the first
implementation, so they are logically different in that sense.

Perhaps each volume (of 100-120 pages maximum, though it could
be less) should just get its own logical name.  The more I think
about it, that might be the _only_ good solution . . . 

What do you think?
