Thanks a lot!  Very nice to make equation writing more simple that way.
And especially having equation numbers and figure numbers is great!

I'll try to do so soon!

By the way, would it be easy to allow an include file to appear
somewhere with a collection of useful ACS Latex macros (like we had
in gravitylab/books/vol_1/def.tex) ?

Thanks!
