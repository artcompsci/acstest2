Hi Jun:

Greetings from Narita airport.  I finally got my internet card to work
and now I have to run to my airplane in one minute -- no time to read
any email.  I did just svn commit a file "leap.rb" where I combined
my shorter files into one.  I agree that this will probably be easier
to read.

More later,

Piet
