Actually, it would be great if we could arrive on January 2.
Indeed, I will depart on January 27.

For now, I have a new class Binary < Worldpoint .
Obviously, it would be better to have a more general class, something
like class Clump < Worldpoint (hopefully with a better name: Group
perhaps?).  However, for now I just wanted to get something ready
quickly.  See "kali/vol/vol-13/world1c.rb" .

One option would be to introduce Worldregion (Worldclump, Worldgroup)
as a subclass of Worldpoint, with Binary perhaps still as a special case,
or not; I have no strong preferences.  Alternatively, we could call it
all just Worldpoint, and add extra variables.  I would prefer, however,
to use a special name for non-point-like Worldpoints, given that we
now have a nice acsio mechanism to deal with those.

In my implementation, the decision to hide two stars in a binary,
and to dissolve a binary, is made on the Worldera level.
Besides "take_snapshot", which does not open binaries, I have a
"take_full_snapshot", mostly for output, which does translate the
relative motions inside binaries back to single particles.

By the way, I would like to make an automatic script now to study the
statistical properties of the full decay history of 8-body systems;
automating Casertano (1985).  Any thoughts about that would be welcome!
I haven't really thought it through very deeply.  I'll probably try to
catch some statistics about binary hardening and escaper production
and half-mass radii.
