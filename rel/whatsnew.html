<hr>

<h3>2006, July 30 - August 11</h3>

<ul>
<li>
A two-week long <a href="http://cambody.org">N-Body Summer School</a>
will be held at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, UK.  Topics
will include computational techniques and stellar evolution processes
including mass loss and collisions, as well as special treatments for
compact subsystems.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2006, July 23 - August 5</h3>

<ul>
<li>
A two-week long <a href="http://www.inaoep.mx/~gh2006/">International
School on Galactic and Cosmological N-Body Simulations</a> will be
held at Tonantzintla, Puebla in Mexico.  Topics will include the

<h3>2006, July 17 - August 11</h3>

<ul>
<li>
A several-week long
<a HREF=http://www.hisp.agnld.uni-potsdam.de/main.html>Sixth

</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2006, April 18</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="index.html#acs123">ACS 1.2.3</a> is released.
ACS 1.2.3 presents only minor changes with respect to the previous
version.  The main addition is our new
<a href="../kali/vol/block\_symmetric/ccode/nbody.c">time-symmetrized
individual-block-time-step code</a>.  As far as we know, this is the
first code that succeeds to apply froward-backward time symmetry to an
individual time step code with block time steps, i.e. with time step
sizes only allowed to be different from each other by integer powers of two.
<li>
For instructions to install the computer codes on your own computer, see the
<a href=README.html>README page</a>.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2006, February 11</h3>

<ul>
<li>
A new <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/N_body">N-body Simulations
bulletin board</a> was created by Cary Walker, with assistance of
Jason Underdown.  The discussions will use the ACS material provided
here as the inspiration for the list and as reference material, but
the bulletin board will be managed independently.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2006, January 14</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="index.html#acs122">ACS 1.2.2</a> is released.
ACS 1.2.2 presents a new lay-out of the ACS home page,
which reflects our latest thoughts about the structure
and evolution of our ongoing projects of development of
simulation code and documentation.
<li>
The <a href="../kali/index.html">Maya Project</a> is the new name for
what we used to call the Kali project.  <i>Maya</i> is now the name
for the software environment within which we will run the <i>Kali code</i>,
which will be our flagship integrator for simulating dense stellar systems.
While <i>Maya</i> will denote our virtual laboratory, <i>Kali</i> will
be our main laboratory tool.
<li>
We have started to rewrite our very first volume,
<a href="../msa/web/vol_1/v1_web/v1_web.html">Moving Stars Around</a>,
to bring it in line with the Maya project.  Specifically, we will use
a much more flexible plotting package, we will introduce a visualization
tool, and all codes will be written in Ruby.
<li>
We have a<a href="../kali/revised-five-year-plan.html">revised
five-year plan</a> for the Kali code development.
<li>
In addition, again a large number of small corrections have been made.
<li>
For instructions to install the computer codes on your own computer, see the
<a href=README.html>README page</a>.

<h3>2005, July 24</h3>

<ul>

School</a> in Amsterdam, Holland, July 24-30, 2005.
</ul>

<h3>2005, July 12</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="index.html#acs121">ACS 1.2.1</a> is released.
ACS 1.2.1 presents the first part of what will be a new volume,
<a href="../kali/vol/multiple_runs/doc/files/_/_title_ok.html">16. 
N-Body Experiments: Orchestrating and Analyzing Multiple Runs</a>
<li>
We have drawn up our <a href="../kali/first-five-year-plan.html">first
five-year plan</a> for the Kali code development.
<li>
In addition, a large number of small corrections have been made.

<h3>2005, April 13</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="index.html#acs12">ACS 1.2</a> is released.
A novel feature of ACS 1.2 is the presentation of an N-body code that
allows individual particles to use not only individual time steps, but
also individual integration algorithms, from a wide range of choices
including <a href="acs-2.1-README.html">... (more)</a>
