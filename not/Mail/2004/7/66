Hi Jun:

Two questions for acsdoc extensions:

1)

If I write something in a chapter to come out under html as:

<i>Programming Ruby -- The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide</i>, by
David Thomas and Andrew Hunt, 2001 [Addison Wesley].  This is a
great introduction to Ruby.  There is a complete <a href="xxx">online
version</a> available for this book.

It would be nice if it would get under LaTeX as follows:

There is a complete <i>online
version</i>(xxx) available for this book.

Could you design a form in which this information can be given,
perhaps as "<acswebref>xxx,online version</acswebref>",
which then will be translated in the above two ways for the
html and ps/pdf versions?  Since there are never commas in
URLs, I think, the first comma will signify the end of the URL.

2)

Could you replace tabs in code text (Ruby and C) with the right
number of spaces?  Right now, I belive the tabs don't appear correctly
in code mode under acsdoc.  I've been taking out tabs by hand, but
whenever I make a modification, emacs tend to put some tabs back
in again, with automatic identation.  It is better to automatize
this.

Piet
