2003, November 13, Thursday, Kyoto: Jun and Piet

1. Yesterday's Lab Notes

We finished writing yesterday's lab notes.  Now that we have decided
upon a format and mechanism, we will try to finish each set of notes
on the day the work described is done.

2. Todo List

We discussed various ways to automate the updating of our todo list.
One option is to include a current version at the end of our local
file, in which we write our session reports.  In that case we could
simply synchronize our todo list by hand.  Another option is to create
a separate todo file and put that under svn; however, chances are that
we then never look at it.

3. Remaining Work for This Week

We decided to write a minimum version of whatever software is needed
to make it possible to put at least some material on our ACS web site,
both the labnotes of the last few days, and a beginning of volume 4,
which could describe the labnote mechanism.

4. Open Kitchen

On our ACS web site, we will add a clickable line, called <i>open kitchen,</i>
which contains in a publicly visible way our ongoing labnotes and
latest drafts of our various volumes.  This will make it much easier
to communicate with others; when asking for comments and suggestions,
we can simply point them to the appropriate descriptions in our book
manuscripts and labnotes.
