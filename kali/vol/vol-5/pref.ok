= Preface

This whole volume is dedicated to a detailed study of Plummer's model.
We could have called it `Plummer for dummies,' because the
explanations and derivations given here are far more extensive than is
usually the case in text books.  Even so, the prefered type of
`dummies' are those that are happy to learn about Abel integral
equations and stuff like that.

We present all results in such an easy-going style, that you don't
even need pen and paper to follow the argument.  The main reason for
this approach is that we want to be realistic in presenting the
discussion as a dialogue.  Whereas text books often state that `it can
be easily seen that', in practice it may well take quite a while, and
a number of pages of paper, before the reader finally has seen what
was supposed to be easy.  In contrast, when two people talk in front
of a blackboard, or bend over a note pad, they don't follow such a
clinical approach.  They are more likely to write things out in
long-hand, and that is exactly what our main characters do in this
volume.

The main purpose for treating Plummer's model with such respect is
that it forms a convenient example for showing how to construct models
in phase space.  Building a structure in six dimensions, rather than three,
is something that you have to get used to.  By the time you are really
experienced doing so, it is easy to forget how counter-intuitive it
probably looked, the first time you gave it a try.  Our approach here
is to present much of the theoretical argumentation that goes into
model building not in an abstract way, but rather with the concrete
example of Plummer's model, and specifically with the even more
concrete question: here is a computer screen, and here is the key board,
now sit down and create a star cluster.

It is this hands-on approach that Alice and Bob continue to pursue, as
they have done in all previous volumes.  In future volumes, they will
no doubt come back to construct King models, as well as anisotropic
and multi-mass generalizations.  They will be able to move along much
faster in those cases, having mastered the main principles while
juggling Plummer's model.  We hope you will enjoy the beauty and
elegance of what is the most venerable star cluster model, with a
history spanning now more than 120 years.

Besides thanking our home institutes, the Institute for Advanced Study
in Princeton and the University of Tokyo, we want to convey our
special gratitude to the Yukawa Institute of Theoretical Physics in
Kyoto, where this volume was written, during a visit in June 2004, made
possible by the kind invitations to both of us by Professor Masao
Ninomiya.
