1. Ruby N-body Integrator

We started with the C++ version of the Hermite code, nbody_sh1.C, that
we introduced in "Moving Stars Around", and we began to rewrite it in
ruby, as nbody_sh1.rb.

We figured out how to write a body class, how to use class variables
to store the shared time in there, as well as the estimated collision
time necessary to compute the new time step.  We also found out how to
use command line arguments, for which there is a nice feature build
in, allowing both single character and full word options.
