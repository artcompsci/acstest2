Ah, wonderful!  That will be very useful for writing volume 2,
later this month.  I look forward to doing that!

This week I'm somehow extremely busy, trying to get all of the non-ACS
mendokusai things out of the way, before flying to Japan early next
week, so that I can then concentrate fully on ACS writing, as I did in
Strasbourg.  So I'm afraid I won't have much time to experiment with
your new acsdoc extensions until perhaps in the plane to Osaka, or
shortly thereafter.

See you in a week,

Piet
