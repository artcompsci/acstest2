== Still more on acsdoc

Remained thing to do

* title

* something like <texonly> for use only inside tex


In HTML generation

* placement of tex image

* config file for macros for tex

* equation numbering?

Let's start with the simplest thing, namely the placement of the tex
image in HTML version.

This turned out to be rather ... nasty, since the easiest way to
change it is to add ALIGN="middle" to IMG tags in HTML, but that tag
is generated in rdoc, not by our acsdoc part.

What I now implemented is to change rdoc source so that it now
add ALIGN= stuff. The other way would be to extend rdoc in a more
generic way, to have something like \<html> ...</html> tag, which
passes the content as is without further complicacy.

Anyway, one thing done. Next: config file.

What config file specifies:

Just the ruby code run in init function for Module Acsdoc.

Done!

initialization file is searched in the order of $ACSDOCINITRC,
./.acsdocinitrc, and ~/.acsdocinitrc.

Equation numbering... 

Memo: simplest way to make big arrows in Tgif: create small figure and
resize if by layout->setreduction.

The way rdoc handles link: is quite annoying. You need to specify
../test.gif, for the file at the directory the command was run (the
current directory).

A better way would be to specify the location relative to the
directory that the .cp file lives.


Memo: to look at older versions of (possibly removed) files in svn,
you can use svn ls and svn cat, like:

  1089  0:44    svn ls -r 299
  1097  0:49    svn cat -r 299 svn+ssh://grape.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/usr2/acs/svn/acs/vol/vol-1/vector1.rb
