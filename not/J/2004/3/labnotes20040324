== More on acsdoc

Actually,  it may be better to use RDtools, instead of RDOC, at least
to make a printable version of the book, since there is at least *some* support
for Latex generation.

One problem clearly is not all macros which are available in RDOC are
not available in RD, and macros to do the same things are not exactly
the same.

From what we know, headers by "=" etc are okay. Practically speaking
all markups (_italic_, *bold*, +typewriter+, by \_italic_, \*bold*, or
\+typewriter+) do not work, because RD markup is
different. ((*bold*)), (({typewriter})),  ((|itaric?|)), ((%another
typewriter%)), ((:Some other font:)). (('no format')), ((<Identity or
URL.)), ((-Footnote-)).

Also, the formats for include and link are different. Rdoc uses
\:include:. while RD uses '<<<' for include. RD uses link: to directly
embed images. 





* I (JM) would like to add to acsdoc.rb the capability to convert an
  arbitrary TeX string to link to its complied image. The only
  question is what format to use. The obvious choice would be someting
  like

     "<tex>   $x=y$ </tex>"

  Is there better possibilities?
