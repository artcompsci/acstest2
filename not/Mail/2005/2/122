I did an svn update, added the line to my .cshrc, and now "make all"
works fine.

Right now, I'm afraid I have no time to work with it further: it's
late already, and I'll have to leave for the airport tomorrow at
6 am . . . after which I will have a three-day conference in Kyoto,
immediately after arriving there.

Let's discuss this further when I meet you on Monday morning in Tokyo
in your office.  Shall we meet around 10 am, as usual, on Feb. 21?
