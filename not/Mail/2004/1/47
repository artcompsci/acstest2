That's a pity.  I did not receive anything yesterday, so indeed it did
not arrive in Princeton.  But what you wrote is clear, and it makes a
lot of sense.  Thanks for your thoughtful feedback!

I agree, that's a good point.

Yes, indeed.

Okay, let me see what I can do.  Right now, I'm still very busy going
through two and a half months of mail, but when I can find some time,
I'll write a new beginning part.

Then, when we both agree on a new approach, I will incorporate your
other suggestions as well.
