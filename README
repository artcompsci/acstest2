README for ACS Version 1.1

Piet Hut and Jun Makino

Here we describe a few basic things about the tarball.

Document volumes:

acs-1.1.tgz comes with entire HTML/PS/PDF documents for the
ACS project. To look at the documents, please start at the top level
index.html file, which points to all volumes available in the current
version.

Source codes:

In the current release, the sources for the volumes and the source
file for programs are in foo/vol/vol-x directories. For example,
the source file rkbody.rb used in volume 1-b of the Kali series
appears as

kali/vol/vol-1b/rkbody.rb

Running programs used in volumes:

Currently, all programs with output shown in one volume are designed
to run at the directory it resides. For example,
integrator_driver4epc.rb in volume 1-b of the Kali series can be run,
assuming you are in the top level directory (at which this README
exists), by:

    cd kali/vol/vol-1b; ruby integrator_driver4epc.rb < euler.in

which should create the same output as what appears in chapter 9 of
this volume.
