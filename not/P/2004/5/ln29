2004, June 5, Saturday, Kyoto: Piet

I created a new directory, kali/vol/vol-11, for volume 11 with as title:
<i>Plummer's Model</i>.  I plan to write the following contents:

* an analytic derivation of the main expressions related to Plummer's model;

* several versions of the code, including com adjustment, quiet start, etc.

* diagnostic tools, such as energy check and Lagrangian quartiles check.
