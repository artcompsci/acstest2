Piet,

Well, I made something up... Please look at kali/vol/code_management

These are specified in Makefile, as

 SCRIPTSRCS = check_and_install.rb acsstart.cshrc

in code_management/Makefile  and

 LIBSRCS = clop.rb

vol-3b/Makefile

"make all" should automatically install these to the right places.

For these, I just made the following two directories

* $ACSROOT/bin ($ACSSCRIPTS)
* $ACSROOT/lib ($ACSLIBS)

You need to source $ACSROOT/bin/acsstart.cshrc in, for example, your
.cshrc file.

For this,

I wrote check_and_install.rb, which is rather clude...
If you have "clop.rb" defined and placed in two different Makefiles,
you would get the error message like:

/home/makino/papers/acs/bin/check_and_install.rb:19:in `check_and_install': Target file comes from /home/makino/papers/acs/kali/vol/vol-3b/clop.rb, different from /home/makino/papers/acs/kali/vol/code_management/clop.rb (RuntimeError)
        from /home/makino/papers/acs/bin/check_and_install.rb:41
make: *** [libs] Error 1

when you try make (or make libs or make scripts) in the directory
different from the directory from where the current version comes. So
if you want to change the location of the original file, you can just
remove the file named

$ACSSCRIPTS/.sourcenames/file_name

(or $ACSLIBS/.sourcenames/file_name)

These file contain just the information of where the real file comes
from.

There are still quite a few things to be set up correctly.
For example, I have not added any execution permission. So for the
files in "bin" ($ACSSCRIPTS) directory, you cannot say, for example,

 mkplummer.rb

You can  say

 ruby -S mkplummer.rb

(if you have put mkplummer.rb to $ACSSCRIPTS directory), though, and
you can use "require" to any files in $ACSLIBS without specifying the
full path (I believe...).

Questions are

 --- should someone set the execution permission? If so, who and how?
 --- or should we have something like "acsruby" command, which takes
     care of all the complex things?

Well, anyway, do you think this is in the right direction?
