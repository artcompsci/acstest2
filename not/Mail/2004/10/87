Ah, yes, that would be much better, of course, I agree.

I just wanted to whip something together quickly, so that I could
start doing automatic 8-body runs.  I would like to automatize
Casertano's 1985 paper, that would be a lot of fun, so I did not
think very deeply about what to do.  In fact, I thought I could
put it together in a few hours -- but it took me about two days
instead, and I'm still finding some bugs.

I guess I will make this really work first, hopefully today, so that
I can start production runs on a few computers here, to gather N=8
statistics.  But yes, after that I will try to clean things up,
along the lines you mentioned.

Yes, very good idea.

It may be better to do this at the worldline level, I'm not sure yet.
The main point is: we would like to make local decisions, but not so
local that they involve only one worldline: they should involve a
small bunch of worldlines -- a Worldlinebundle may be a good concept.

So the main question is: what are the interrelationships between the
following classes:

  Worldline
  Worldbundle
  Worldsnapshot  and also some form of  Worldbundle-snapshot
  Worldera

The role of era could be to guarantee to a wordbundle that it is
isolated.  So era is invoked to make a global snapshot, and then,
when it is clear that a clump (intersection of bundle and snapshot)
is isolated, then the Worldbundle does the rest, without any need
for era to step in.  Does that sound reasonable?

Yes, indeed.  Let us see how far we get with a few email messages.
I will forward the previous email messages to not, and this one as well.
Perhaps in a few days we can have a phone discussion, if it gets too
complicated for email.

Are you back in Tokyo now?
