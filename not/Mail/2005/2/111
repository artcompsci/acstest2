Okay, well, so we should have, for each volume directory

 * some way to specify which files are commnds
 * some way to specify which files are libraries

And, we need a way to specify

 * directory to install commands
 * directory to install libraries
 * (checking stuff I wrote above)

Hmm, well, this means that we need some startup or initialization
script (sourced in .cshrc), which add things like environmental
variables and command search path.

Shall I implement some prototype?

These layers still do not really solve your problem:

If you have, for example,

  kira/vol/clop/clop.rb -> exported to standard library location
  kira/vol/individual/clop.rb -> local one

when you run a program at   kira/vol/individual, it probably should
look at kira/vol/individual/clop.rb. When it is installed to the
command directory, it would look at the starndard one. So we can
easily confuse ourselves...
