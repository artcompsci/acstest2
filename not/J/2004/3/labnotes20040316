== Updating svn on Piet's  machine

You probably need the following:

subversion-1.0.1.tar.gz
Python-2.3.3.tgz
binutils-2.14.tar.gz
db-4.2.52.NC.tar.gz
autoconf-2.59.tar.gz
libtool-1.5.2.tar.gz

So let's make a combined tar file.

  tar cvf svnall.tar subversion-1.0.1.tar.gz Python-2.3.3.tgz \
                   binutils-2.14.tar.gz db-4.2.52.NC.tar.gz \
                   autoconf-2.59.tar.gz libtool-1.5.2.tar.gz

It turned out you need to install apache-2.0.48. It was simple:

   tar xvzf httpd-2.0.48.tar.gz
   cd  httpd-2.0.48
   configure
   make
   sudo make install

and then

   cd sub*1
   ./configure --with-ssl
   make
   sudo make install   

For whatever reason, you need --with-ssl. If you omit it, NEON is
still compiled with -DNEON_SSL, but -lssl is omitted, at least on
Piet's machine, which means it compiled and linked, but failed to run
since the runtime cannot file functions like SSL_load_error_strings.
