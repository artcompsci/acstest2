<h3>2004, June 5</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="index.html">ACS 1.0.1</a> is released, and contains:
<ul>
<li>
A sixth-order integrator, described in volume 2, chapter 5,
and in volume 3, chapter 11
<li>
postscript and pdf files, that were left out inadvertently from ACS 1.0
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2004, June 2</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="index.html">ACS 1.0</a> is released, and contains:
<ul>
<li>
several new volumes, including roughly 500 pages of new text
<li>
a dialogue between two researchers, rather than between the three
students as was the case in <i>Moving Stars Around</i>
<li>
a switch from C++ to Ruby
<li>
a clear plan for extending the current material to construct a new
simulation code for dense stellar systems, the Kali code, in the
course of the next several years.
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2003, March 19</h3>

<ul>
<li>
For an <a href="http://astro.u-strasbg.fr/scyon/School/">N-Body School</a>
in Strassbourg, France,
<ul>
<li>
we listed the manuscript <i>Moving Stars Around</i> as required reading
<li>
we helped the students to adapt the various ACS source codes to their
own projects
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2003, October 7</h3>

<ul>
<li>
We made the manuscript <a href="../msa/web/index.html">Moving
Stars Around</a> available on the ACS web site.  It contains:
<ul>
<li>
a dialogue between three students, who start setting up N-body
codes from scratch, using the C++ computer language
<li>
roughly 270 pages of text, in postcript, pdf, and html format
<li>
all C++ codes and scripts mentioned in the text
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2003, September 18</h3>

<ul>
<li>
We acquired the domain name "ArtCompsSci.org", and started to build
the ACS web site.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2003, June 26</h3>

<ul>
<li>
We hit upon the concept of the Kali code:
<ul>
<li>
a computer code for simulations of dense stellar systems, including
stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, and stellar hydrodynamics
<li>
fully modular, and defined on all levels by interface specifications
<li>
different modules, such as the (global or local) integrator or (global
or local) force calculator can all be written in different languages
by different people.
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2002, June 30</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Following the first
<a href="http://www.manybody.org/modest.html">MODEST</a> workshop,
we wrote a <a href="http://www.manybody.org/modest/modest_star.html">toy
model</a> featuring
<ul>
<li>
a specific example of a code interface between stellar evolution and stellar
dynamics
<li>
versions of codes and drivers, in C++ as well as Fortran
<li>
a brief description, and sample output
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2001, November 23</h3>

<ul>
<li>
We started writing the first manuscript of what would become the ACS series.
Our provisional title at that time was <i>Pure Gravity: Particles at Play</i>.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2001, March 21</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Following a <a href="http://www.us-vo.org/">Virtual Observatory</a> workshop
in Tucson, we wrote a simple toy model for stellar evolution, in order
to explore some of the fundamental issues in writing modular codes for
dense stellar systems.
</ul>
