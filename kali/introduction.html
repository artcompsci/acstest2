<h3>
The Gravitational Million-Body Problem
</h3>

When Newton developed classical mechanics, including the classical
theory of gravity, his main application was the N-body problem.  The
term <i>problem</i> is used in mathematics and therefore also in
mathematical physics to indicate a topic with a question that has not
(yet) been solved.  For example, the famous four-color problem, the
question of how many different colors we need to introduce to color a
map such that neighboring countries can always be given different
colors, remained a real problem until the nineteen seventies. Partly
with the help of computers, this problem was solved (the answer was:
four colors suffice), and then the four-color problem turned into the
four-color theorem.  Similarly, the same term `problem' was used to
describe the challenge to find the motions of two, three, or more
bodies under the influence of their mutual gravitational attractions:
hence the two-body problem, the three-body problem, etc.
<p>
Unlike the four-color problem, though, we don't expect to ever `solve'
the gravitational N-body problem, for arbitrary N ­ and even for N = 2,
where we do have analytic solutions, we still follow tradition in
calling this the two-body problem (strictly speaking, this probably
should be called the two-body system).  Why would someone want to
study the gravitational million-body problem? There are at least four
quite different motivations, centering on the fields of astronomy,
theoretical physics, computational physics, and mathematics.  We
summarize these four here briefly; for a lenghtier introduction, see
part I of
<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521774861">The
Gravitational Million-Body Problem</a> (Heggie &amp; Hut, 2003).
<p>
For astronomers, the study of dense stellar systems forms the most
challenging area of stellar physics.  Systems are called dense if the
stars are so closely packed in space that they will occasionally
suffer close encounters and even physical collisions.  Two examples
of dense stellar systems are globular clusters and galactic nuclei.
In our own Milky Way galaxy, at least, the typical number of stars in
a globular cluster lies between 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup>,
and the number of stars directly influenced by the massive central
black hole is between 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup>.  So even
though our galaxy as a whole contains a hundred billion stars, the
most interesting dense stellar systems in our galaxy can be described
by the gravitational million-body problem.
<p>
For theoretical physicists, the study of self-gravitating systems of
particles is challenging because such systems cannot be described by
standard thermodynamic methods.  The methods of plasma physics fail
because gravitational forces, being attractive, are unshielded.
Historically, many developments in mathematical physics, from
perturbation theory to the discovery of chaos, were triggered by
problems encountered in trying to acquire a deeper understanding of
the N-body problem.
<p>
For computational physicists, the N-body problem is one of the prime
examples of hard problems.  In fact, it is not even clear whether any
solution can be obtained reliably at all, given the exponential
divergence of orbital solutions.  And apart from such fundamental
issues, running an N-body simulation with N > 10,000 is exceptionally
time-consuming for even the fastest generally available computers. This
has led to the development of special computers (the 
<a href="http://www.astrogrape.org/">GRAPE</a> family), whose main
task is to solve this problem very quickly.  Developing the software
for running N-body simulations is equally challenging.  In globular
cluster simulations, we are confronted with length scales spanning
the range from kilometers to parsecs (a factor of more than
10<sub>13</sub>), and with time scales spanning the range from
milliseconds to the life time of the universe (a factor of more than
10<sub>20</sub>).
<p>
For mathematicians, there has been a steady flow of inspiration
stemming from the N-body problem. When Newton laid the foundations of
classical physics in the Principia, among the mathematical tools he
deployed was the infinitesimal calculus, which he had invented for the
purpose.  The famous theorem of Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser was
foreshadowed by the work of C.L. Siegel in his book on Celestial
Mechanics, a form of the gravitational N-body problem.

The Need for a New Approach

Science is undergoing its second revolution.  From theory only for the
Greeks, to theory and experiment around 1600, to theory, experiment
and simulations now.  We don't know yet how to write large software
systems.
