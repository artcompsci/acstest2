1. Emacs Outline Mode

I realized that I misunderstood the ruby syntax of "until":
the line:

\begincode

    s = gets until s != "\n"

\endcode

does not execute the first expression even one time, if the second
expression evaluates to false; this is unlike C++.  This means that I
had to modify the code I mentioned yesterday \ref 2003-11-14-001-1.3.

In addition, I decided to place the leading "*" in front of the
automatically generated header, rather than the first line of the
report.  This will guarantee more uniformity.  Here is the new version
of the Ruby conversion script:

\begincode

 #!/usr/local/bin/ruby -w
 #
 #  not2outline.rb
 #
 #  this script converts the "all.not" file to usage in emacs outline mode
 #
 #  usage:  not2outline.rb < all.not > allout.not
 #          emacs allout.not
 #
 
 while s = gets
   s = " " + s if s == "\n"
   if s =~ /^\\header/
     s = "* " + s 
     print "\n"      # to suppress blank line before header line in folded mode
   end
   print s
 end

\endcode

2. Ruby Vector Class

I started to browse in Ruby source code and manuals and books, to get
a feeling for how to translate our "nbody_sh1.C" code into ruby.  It
seemed that the Array default size is set to 16.  This may be a reason
to define our own short-vector class, since we typically deal with
only 3 or 4 members (in 3D or in regularized 4D), although in practice
this memory overhead may not be much of a problem.
