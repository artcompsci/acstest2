What I had in mind was something like the following: Imagine that we
have

* make kali

as an entry for TODO file at certain point. At day 200x/yy/zz, we
completed kali. So we want to remove this entry from TODO file. So we
can just remove it from TODO file. For the record, however, it may be
useful to keep it in labnote, at the date 200x/yy/zz, as, for example,

* Work done: removed from TODO
   * make kali

To have a specific format here may be useful, but not absolutely
necessary, since we record the trace of TODO file in svn anyway.
