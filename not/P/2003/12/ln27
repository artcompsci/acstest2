2003, December 27, Saturday, Kyoto: Piet

1. SVN local listing

I wrote a short script "$ACSROOT/bin/svn_local_list.rb".  When you run
this in any directory, it lists all files that are currently under svn
control, even files that have been added but not yet committed.  Most	
importantly, this script can be run without internet connection, unlike
the command "svn list" wchich checks the repository over the net.  To
make life even easier, I added the following alias in my .cshrc file:

    alias sl 'ruby $ACSROOT/bin/svn_local_list.rb'

2. Book Chapters

I made a new directory $ACSROOT/dia, for dialogues, and set up files
there for chapters of our ACS 0.1 book: pref.cp, ch1.cp, etc.  I
brought everything under rdoc, lab notes, code, and book text, through
the following line to my .cshrc file:

    alias acsdoc 'cd $ACSROOT/dia ; \
      ruby $ACSROOT/src/coherent_programming/acsdoc.rb \
      --inline-source $ACSROOT/not/combined/* *.cp *.rb'
