<b> What is the Goal of the ACS project?</b>
<p>
Our long-term goal is to establish a community of professionals and
amateurs, interested in making science available in a hands-on way,
loosely modeled on the various open-source communities, of which the
Linux project is probably the most visible one.
<p>
Science may well be the oldest and largest open source project of all
times.  Since the days of Galileo, more than a dozen generations of
scientists have worked together to produce a public body of knowledge
about the natural world that is unique both in its accuracy, and in
the fact that it transcends traditional boundaries of cultures and
belief systems.
<p>
The ACS project aims at rekindling the spirit of the
eighteenth-century enlightenment movement, where educated lay people
were invited to join professional scientists in their explorations.
The main shifts are from traditional salons to the world wide web,
and from tabletop experiments to laptop computers.

<hr>

<b>How can I Play with an N-body Code?</b>
<p>
A quick way to get started is to read our older on-line book <a
href="../msa/web/index.html">Moving Stars Around</a>.  There you will
find a complete introduction, in 250 pages, illustrated with C++
codes.  Starting with very simple integrators, but moving on to the
Hermite scheme, the readers will be invited to perform cold collapse
experiments, to study binary formation, and to adapt the codes for
their own purposes.
<p>
A more detailed approach to working with N-body codes can be found in
our multi-volume series, the <a href="../kali/index.html">Kali code</a>,
where we are developing a state-of-the-art software environment for
simulating dense stellar systems.  Here, too, we start from scratch,
with simple integrators for the 2-body problem, before moving on to a
large choice of higher-order integrators for the general N-body problem.
<p>
Since our preferred computer language,
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, may not be familiar to
our readers, the Kali series introduces the language together
with the math, physics, and computer science needed for studying the
N-body problem.

<hr>

<b>Why Use Ruby?</b>
<p>
Ruby combines the flexibility of a scripting language with the power
of a fully object-oriented programming language.  For a large-scale
software project, such as the development of the
<a href="../kali/index.htm"l>Kali code</a>, it is essential to use data
encapsulation, such as offered by C++.  However, when developing new
code, it is impossible to know beforehand what the best data structures
will look like.  Rapid prototyping, all but impossible in C++, is equally
essential for developing code that is well-thought-out and easy to read,
not stuck in a legacy of historical data design decisions.

<hr>

<b> Is Ruby Fast Enough?</b>
<p>
No, Ruby by itself is too slow for serious scientific simulations.
However, it is straightforward to replace a few time-critical lines of
Ruby code with C code, thereby speeding up the original Ruby code to a
speed that can approximate that of C code without much trouble.  See
<a href="../kali/vol/vol-6/doc/files/_/_title_ok.html">Vol. 6: Speedup</a> for
detailed examples.

<hr>

<b> Why So Many Volumes?</b>
<p>
Most scientific text books summarize the state of the art of a field
`after the dust has settled.'  Students are presented with a clean
path of logic that bears little resemblance to the historical process
of trial and error that underlies any scientific discovery, large or
small.  In comparison, there is not much information available that
teaches students how to make mistakes and learn from them.  In
contrast, our aim is to present much of the tacit knowledge that is
essential for starting a research project in computational science.
<p>
Initially, we expected to be able to present our series in ten volumes.
However, when we completed our first volume, <i>Moving Stars Around</i>, and
published it on the web in October 2003, we learned two important lessons:
1) until you start making implicit knowledge explicit, you have no idea
how much you know; 2) when you start this process, you learn an awful lot,
adding to the store of your knowledge at roughly the same pace as you are
writing it up.  We now consider several tens of volumes to be a more
realistic estimate, even just for the <i>Kali</i> series.
<hr>

<b> Why the Name Kali?</b>
<p>
We borrowed the name from the Sanskrit <i>kali</i>, meaning
<i>dark</i>, as in the <i>kali yuga</i>, the dark ages we are currently in
according to Hindu mythology.  The same word also occurs in the name
<i>Kali</i>, for the Hindu Goddess who is depicted as black.  The term
<i>dark</i> seemed appropriate for our project of focusing on forms of
tacit knowledge that have not been brought to light, so far, and
perhaps cannot be presented in a bright, logical series of statements.
Instead, we expect our dialogues to carry the many less formal and
less bright shades of meaning, that pervade any craft.

<hr>

<b> I am an amateur astronomer.  Is this for me?</b>
<p>
Absolutely!  We very much hope that you will download our software,
and explore the virtual heavens on your computer, just as you explore
the actual heavens with your telescope.  We have tried to make our
presentation self-contained.  In addition, we will continue to add
explanations and provide more pointers to background information, as
needed.
<p>
If you find that there are key points that are not yet clearly explained,
or missing altogether, please feel free to
<a href="mailto:comments@artcompsci.org">let us know</a>.  We may not
find the time to respond and thank each of you individually, but rest
assured that your comments will be greatly appreciated.

<hr>

<b> How can I help?</b>
<p>
Since we are still in the initial phase of setting up the ACS project,
most of our attention is currently focused on writing enough volumes
to present a full working environment for N-body simulations.  We
expect to finish this initial phase some time in 2005.  From then on,
there will be increasingly many opportunities to join us in our attempt
to produce a virtual astronomy laboratory.
<p>
Opportunities for software development will range from specialized
areas in computational astrophysics and numerical methods to more
general areas in graphics and user interfaces, and parallelizing codes.
In addition, we will need much help in getting our environment ported
to a range of different platforms and operating systems.
<p>
As our project will grow larger, and our user base will increase, we
will need volunteers to answer routine inquiries, and to help
beginners to get started.  In addition, it would be wonderful to make
translations of our material available to a wide audience fluent in
other languages than English.
<p>
If you would like to make a serious contribution in any of these
areas, please <a href="mailto:comments@artcompsci.org">contact us</a>.
