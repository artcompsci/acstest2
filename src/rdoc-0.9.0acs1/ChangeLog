		was a Windows box.

2003-03-08  Dave Thomas  <pragdave@wireless_5.local.thomases.com>

		  allowing additional characters breaks escaping of inline
		  sequences.

2003-02-27  Dave Thomas  <pragdave@wireless_5.local.thomases.com>

	* markup/sample/sample.rb: Forgot to change the sample when I
		  changed the interface. Thanks to Barrie Stott for
		  pointing this out.

2003-02-20  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* markup/simple_markup/to_html.rb: Add smart quotes, but then
	comment it out because many browsers seem not to support the
	characters. Gie it a couple of months...

2003-02-19  Dave Thomas  <pragdave@wireless_6.local.thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_rb.rb: support :nodoc: for alias

	'private', 'protected', and 'public'.

2003-01-27  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_rb.rb: Be cleverer about class << Constant,
	correctly appending to an existing class if it can find one.

2003-01-27  Nobu Nokada  <nobu.nokada@softhome.net>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_rb.rb:
	  - here document without terminator hangs rdoc up.
	  - should not truncate input content at __END__, it can appear\
	    in literals.
	  - anything after =end should be ignored.


2003-01-24  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_rb.rb: Change handling of symbols. This now
	strips off the leading ':', so that attributes now display as just
	their names. This also fixes #673996 (private :name not working).

	* markup/simple_markup/inline.rb: As an experiment, allow any
	non-whitespace between *'s, +'s, and _'s, so that *thx1138* will
	embolden the word, and _&^%&^%$_ will swear in italic.

2003-01-20  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_c.rb: As a temporary move towards handling
	commented out methods, we now ignore those whose rb_defines follow
	a '//'. Also, be more liberal in the names of methods we recognize

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_rb.rb: Now ignores class << <something>
	unless <something> is 'self' _or_ the exact name of the enclosing class.

	* rdoc/options.rb: Ensure help text goes to stdout.

2003-01-13  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	hyperlinks.

	* rdoc/options.rb: Help output now goe to stdout.

	* markup/simple_markup.rb: If you have lists whose only content is
	headings, the fragment decoder was getting confused. Removed all
	non-list list entries for now.

2002-09-26  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_c.rb: Fix to parsing of RB_METHOD_FUNC

	:yield: or :yields: was given for a method.
	
2002-09-18  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parserfactory.rb etc...: Add various resets to
	allow the api version to be called multiple times.

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb (document): Use 'require' rather than load to load
	in the generator.

2002-07-22  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/options.rb: Ease up the test for 'dot' version, as the
	1.8.6 required is only available in CVS right now.

	* beta-2

2002-07-16  Bil Kleb  <TheKlebs@Yahoo.Com>

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: Add require for Fortran 95 parser.
	* rdoc/parsers/parse_f95.rb: Tracer bullet Fortran 95 parser.

	template similar to kilmer.rb.

2002-07-15  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_rb.rb: Handle "class << 'string'" and other
	cases where the token following the '<<' doesn't respond to .name.

2002-07-09  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_rb.rb: Fix problem with symbols being added

	* rdoc/options.rb: Remove dot version test under Windows, and
	require dot version 1.8.
	

2002-07-02  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/diagram.rb: Werner Neubauer 
	<Werner.Ex.Neubauer@mchp.siemens.de> added a whole lot of new
	diagramming support, so it now draws module relationships. He also
	fixed a number of bugs in my code

2002-06-30  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* code_objects/parse_c/parse_rb: (Bil Kleb) Remove causes of some
	warnings, and fix Dave's notoriously bad grammar/spelling.

2002-06-27  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_rb.rb: Ignore stuff after __END__. Remove
	warning if argument to 'include' isn't a constant.
	

	* rdoc/code_objects.rb: Don't overwrite existing comments with a

	* rdoc/parsers/parserfactory.rb: Eliminate the need for rdoc.rb to
	know the actual extensions of files.

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_c.rb: Fix problem with lexical state not
	being correct if a function definition containing an operator
	immediately followed an alias ending in an operator.

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: Fixed problem where RDoc didn't expand ~'s in $:
	when looking for generators (Massimiliano Mirra) 

2002-06-11  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_c.rb: Patches from Mike Witrant to support
	.cc files, and to fix some bugs in C parsing. Added experimental
	code for extracting C method bodies.
	

2002-06-05  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parse_rb.rb: Allow parentheses around the name of
	an included module

	* rdoc/code_objects.rb: I checked in a partial change which broke
	class hierarchies. Fortunately some anonymous person came up with
	a fix for me :)

2002-05-20  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parserfactory.rb: Now prepend new parsers to the
	list, so the last ones added are the first ones found. This
	enables user-written parsers to override built-in ones.

2002-05-13  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parsers/parserfactory.rb: Wasn't thinking straight when I
	coded the default handling for returning a SimpleParser for
	unknown file types.

2002-05-09  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* all: Reorganize parsers to make it easier to add new ones 

2002-05-01  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* install.rb (template): Use the correct installed name for the
	Ruby interpreter (previously assumed it was always 'ruby'). Patch
	from Kazuhiro NISHIYAMA (znz).

2002-04-11  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: We were generating files for
	:nodoc: classes, even though they weren't referenced from anywhere.

2002-03-31  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/c_parse.rb: c_parse wasn't handling
	define_class|module_under correctly.

2002-03-30  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/template.rb: If you have >2 sub directories, the
	template system was getting confused by the substitution
	of %2f's for /'s. Also fix bug where template lines containing
	HREFs were getting overwritten.
	

	* beta-1

2002-03-29  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/generators/xxx_generator.rb: Oops - fell into the old trap
	of assuming ctime was time of creation. Removed all ctime
	references.

	* rdoc/parse.rb: We weren't picking up the documentation modified
	for classes if the superclass was an expression.

	* rdoc/options.rb: Fix stupid bug with 'generators' being
	undefined if 'fot' is missing.

2002-03-20    <dave@thomases.com>

	* rdoc\generators\html_generator.rb: Fix the href for methods when
	we generate a single file. It used to contain the class name, but
	this isn't needed in one file.

2002-03-12  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/generators/chm_generator.rb: Include NaHi's patch to allow
	cygwin to run hhc if there are spaces in the path.

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: Make the error about writing to an existing output
	directory more explicit.

	* rdoc/template.rb: Rewrite totally. Templates now resolve
	symbol names using scopes, so we no longer have the problem
	with resolving inner names in nested constructs. Fix up the
	various templates accordingly. While we're in there, reduce the
	space after a method name in the standard HTML template.

2002-03-11  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: The character following a '\' in strings was
	being swallowed if it wasn't a recognized escape character.

2002-03-07    <dave@pragprog.com>

	* rdoc\generators\chm_generator.rb: Add support for .chm file
	generation

2002-03-05  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

2002-03-04  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	not .rb or .c) which contain just a block comment.

2002-02-28  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/code_objects.rb: Comments were being lost on attributes

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: Add xml support. Reorganize the template
	directories. Add the -one-file option.

2002-02-21  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Add :notnew: modifier to methods. This stops
	#initialize being mapped automatically to ::new.

	* rdoc/options.rb: Add --inline-source to allow source code to be
	included in the body of the document, and not in popups.

2002-02-19  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* markup/simple_markup.rb: Limit == header depth to 6

	* rdoc/generators/html_template/standard.rb (BODY): Thanks to
	MoonWolf for the --charset patch.

2002-02-17  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

2002-02-15  Sergey Yanovitsky <Sergey.Yanovitsky@itgrp.net>

	* rdoc/options.rb (options): Add ability to choose output image
	format. 

2002-02-15  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Fixed yet another bug with optional 'do' after
	'while'. 

2002-02-12  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: Fix silly bug with leading ./ on file names.

	* rdoc/generators/html_template/standard.rb (STYLE): Drop the font
	size of <pre> down to 1.1em.

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: Sort list of classes and
	modules in the summary page.

	* rdoc/c_parse.rb: Add support for parsing C extensions.

2002-02-11  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Handle case of "a = 2*(1+yield)", where
	previously the ')' was being picked up as part of the yield
	parameter. I don't think I can do much more without going for a
	full parse.

2002-02-10  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/diagram.rb: Make diagrams honor --quiet.

	* MANIFEST: Separated out the main driver program from rdoc.rb,
	so that it's now easier to embed.

2002-02-08  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Christoph Rippel sent in a patch to remove the
	messy eval and use Class.new instead. This also fixes a
	compatibility problem with the latest 1.7 Ruby.

2002-02-07  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: We need to build symbols as a single token,
	otherwise :module and :class will confuse the parse.		

	* rdoc/diagram.rb: Integrate change to diagrams from Sergey - it
	can now optionally draw boxes on diagrams to show what files
	classes are in.

2002-02-06  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Try to fix a bug in the parsing of
	while/until. The optional 'do' parameter was being taken as a
	block start, and increasing the nesting. Skipping it is a bit
	difficult, so we'll see if this works in all cases the old
	fashioned way--by releasing it and seeing if anyone screams :)

2002-02-05  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: Remove characters from
	filenames that might not be supported under DOS

2002-02-01  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: Add the --show-hash option.

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Ignore \r characters in 'gets', so that chomp
	works under Windows with \r\n line endings.

	* rdoc/options.rb: Change from using backticks to using IO.popen
	to avoid cygwin bug.

2002-01-31  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: Thanks to Niklas Frykolm,
	Gunnar Andersson, and Thomas Hurst, we're now closer to generating
	conformant HTML.

2002-01-30  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/generators/html_template/kilmer.rb: Add diagram support

2002-01-29  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/diagram.rb: Add support for client-side imagemaps, based on
	a method from Tony Smith.

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: Add method and class name as
	title to source popup. Also there was a bug if you tried to run
	RDoc from the installation directory, rather than installing
	it. Output templates weren't being found, as the search path was
	relative to the starting dir, but the directory got changed during
	processing.


2002-01-28  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Bil Kleb sent in patches for some typos.

2002-01-26  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Change handling of initial comment. Now a blank
	line will terminate the initial comment. This means that if you
	have

	   # Comment a

	   # Comment b
	   class Fred ...

	"Comment a" will be the file comment and "Comment b" the class
	comment. Previously the two comments were concatenated, and the
	result was both the file and the class comment.

	* MANIFEST: Added EXAMPLE.rb, and include it in the rdoc.rb
	header. 

2002-01-25  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Fix bug that failed to interpret '<<' as a method
	name.

	* rdoc/generators/html_template/standard.rb: Add support for
	generation of arbitrary files to output templates.
	

	* rdoc/options.rb (options): Add check for the existence of files
	on the command line.

	* rdoc/generators/html_template/kilmer.rb (STYLE): Remove padding
	on srclink to make it work with NS4.7

2002-01-24  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: Fix Java-style 'new RDocError'
	
	* alpha-9: released
	
	* rdoc/options.rb: added --help option.

	* rdoc/diagram.rb: Jah of Enticla added wonderful support for
	diagramming classes and modules. Added new -d option to turn it
	on, and renamed the debug option -D.

	* rdoc/generators/html_template/kilmer.rb (INDEX): Add support for
	generating the blank page needed as the initial src= in the source
	frame.

2002-01-21  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Incorporate patch from Leslie A Hensley: we
	weren't correctly parsing superclasses that contained '::'s

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Fix bug that incorrectly complained about "yield
	outside block" in nodoc'd classes.
	

2002-01-19  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* markup/simple_markup.rb: Allow the body of labeled lists
	to start on the line following the label, thus avoiding those
	hideously indented blocks.

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Make $+ and other backref's into Id's, so they
	can be used in aliases. Allow argument to 'require' to have
	parentheses. Record name of singleton classes as '<<xx' (not
	ideal--anyone think of a better way?).
	

2002-01-18  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/generators/html_template/kilmer.rb (BODY): Add dummy 'src='
	to source frame.

2002-01-17  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/generators/html_template/standard.rb: Fix up cross
	reference link colors. Make titles of index windows hyperlinks to
	the main page.

	* markup/simple_markup/to_html.rb: The #wrap method was fairly
	expensive, and had a bug if a chunk of non-space text was >
	linelen, so let's rewrite it.

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: Add --template option and the
	ability to switch html output templates.

2002-01-16  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc-alpha-8 released

2002-01-15  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Method parameters lists are going to be the death
	of me. Continue to try to work on determining exactly when a
	parameter list ends by testing for the lexical state, rather than
	just the continue flag.

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Fix lexing bug: '<<' wasn't setting the state to
	EXPR_BEG. 

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: No support :nodoc: at the
	file level too.

2002-01-14  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Add #++ flag to allow commenting to be
	switched back on after a #--.

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: Michael Granger (perlmage) provided a patch to let
	RDoc detect third-party output generators.

	* rdoc/options.rb: Add --title option, and ensure that class pages
	now have the correct title.

	* rdoc-alpha-7 released

2002-01-13  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: Support :include: directive and the --include
	command line option.

2002-01-12    <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc\rdoc.rb: Add and document the :nodoc: modifier.

2002-01-12  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Start implementing documentation modifiers.

2002-01-11  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* markup/simple_markup.rb: Support horizontal rules (indicated
	using three or more hyphens).

	* rdoc/code_objects.rb: Patch from Alan Chen to fix a warning
	about an uninitialized instance variable.

2002-01-10  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: Hyperlinks to the web (http,
	mailto, and ftp) are recognized. Links to images become inline
	<img> tags.

2002-01-09  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/html_pages.rb: Work on browser compatibility. This ended up
	being pretty much a complete rewrite of the output. It ended up
	being a lot simpler.

	* rdoc/README.rb: added.
	

2002-01-08  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Fix problem with lexing of numbers starting with
	a '0' which caused an extra character to be eaten. If this happens
	at the end of a line, the NL gets swallowed, and the lexer is left
	in the wrong state.

	* rdoc\html_pages.rb (CLASS_PAGE): The Parent class is now shown
	as a hyperlink if possible.

	* rdoc\parse.rb: Allow "def Fred::barney" (previously only
	supported "def Fred.barney"

	* rdoc\rdoc.rb: RDoc can now be invoked conveniently from a program

	* rdoc\options.rb (options): Add --quiet option

2002-01-07  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Fix bug where we sometimes swallowed the first
	token of the method body. If this was an 'if', 'while', or 'case',
	we got out of sync with the nesting level.

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Add line numbers to warnings and errors.

	* markup/simple_markup/inline.rb: Fix bug which caused last
	character in markup to be missed if it followed a Special sequence.

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: When generating cross
	references in comments for class and module names, we first check
	for classes and modules local to the current module before looking
	for global names.
	

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: RDoc now stops processing comments when it sees a
	line containing '#--'. This allows you to have internal comments
	and external comments in one block.

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Fix problem reading yield parameters. Also fix
	problem where the 'yields: a,b' comment following a method
	definition wasn't being picked up correctly if the definition had
	'()' 

	* rdoc/generators/html_generator.rb: Add titles to the index frames.

	* rdoc: alpha-6 released.
	
	* rdoc: Numerous changes to support the accumulation of
	multiple definitions for the same class and module into one place.

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Report source file and line number in code
	samples, and indent first line correctly.

	* markup/simple_markup/inline.rb: Rewrite the attribute
	parsing/handling code to get rid of the ugly inline
	substitutions. It's still pretty ugly, but now it's easier to
	combine attributes.

2002-01-05  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* markup/simple_markup/inline.rb: Allow special sequences to be
	marked up as well. For example, previously, +String+ was not
	converted because 'String' was recognized as a potential hyperlink
	and this stopped the +..+ recognition thinking it was a
	word. Fixes bug 499564.

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: Add support for pluggable output formatters (still
	only supply HTML)

2002-01-03  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* markup/simple_markup/inline.rb: Following change to allow
	internal underscores in word-based markup, we can now support
	things like *cat_and_dog*.

	* rdoc/html_pages.rb (BODY): Make popups resizable and scrollable.

2002-01-02  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* markup/simple_markup/inline.rb: Change interpretation of
	word-based inline markup so that "cat_and_dog" is now literally
	"cat_and_dog" and not "cat<em>and</em>dog".

	* rdoc/html_generator.rb: Fix problem where squeeze was removing
	_all_ duplicate characters, not just spaces.

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb (files): Add a simple progress meter

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Detect and skip require when the argument is a
	dynamic string.
	
	* rdoc/parse.rb: Fix parsing of method parameters so that
	     def fred() @a end
	no longer returns @a and 'end' as part of the parameter string.
	

2001-12-20  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/html_generator.rb: Fix up problem with bad cross references
	if outputting to a non-standard directory

	* install.rb,markup/install.rb (sitedir): Tidy up - we were
	creating bindirs and the like that we didn't need.

2001-12-19  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Fix problem if file doesn't end with a
	newline. (The input code in the lexer needs refactoring)

2001-12-18  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Add support for documenting the block associated
	with a method by detecting the parameters to yield and allowing
	an explicit '# yields: x,y' comment

	* rdoc/rdoc.rb: Allow '-' to introduce bulleted lists

	* parse.rb: Fix problem with -@ and +@ in method names

2001-12-17  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Terminate search for method parameters on a
	semicolon

	* rdoc/html_generator.rb: Fix problem with cross-references of the
	form '#abc_def' (i.e., with an internal underscore). They were
	getting matched by two rules, and hence getting substituted twice.

2001-12-16  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Parse :<op> as a function name in alias and
	visibility constraints.
	

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Fix token type for %= to TkOPASGN

	* rdoc/parse.rb: Allow expressions after class <<

	* rdoc/parse.rb: parse_alias. Set lex state to EXPR_FNAME so that
   	         alias :a :b
	recognizes :b correctly. Allow arbitrary IDs (including names
	such as 'next' and global variables) as parameters for 'alias'
