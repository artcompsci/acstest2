= Preface

This volume will show several ways for speeding up Ruby code, by
replacing a small amount of time-critical Ruby lines by short C functions.
We have started writing some text here, but the bulk of the text will
appear later, by late 2004 or early 2005.

== Acknowledgments

We thank xxx, xxx, and xxx for their comments on the
manuscript.
