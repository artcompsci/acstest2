= Diagnostics

== Evolve

You are familiar already with the accessor shorthand that gives read
and write handles to the internal variables for the mass, position,
and velocity, as well as with the initialization method, that uses our
nifty vector class.

The first new function is is +evolve+, the one function that the driver
program invokes, and that guides all the work.  Here it is, by itself:

 :inccode: .body.rb+evolve

*Bob*: At the top, it sets two counters to zero.  One is +time+, which
measures how the simulated time during wchich the two-body motion is
integrated, so that the calculation can be halted properly after an
amount of time equal to <tt>dt_end</tt> has passed.  The other is
+nsteps+, the number of time steps that the system has taken.  I keep
track of that, since I like to know how much work the code has done,
at any given point.

*Alice*: With a constant time step, you could also divide the total
integration time by the step size.

*Bob*: Of course, but in future codes we'll soon switch to variable
time steps, in which case you have no independent way of knowing how
many steps the code took.  So we may as well get into the habit of
reporting that number.

*Alice*: In the third line you introduce a variable.  What is it
doing there, all by itself?  It looks a bit lonely and lost.

== Brevity and Modularity

*Bob*: Ah, the brevity of Ruby!  +e_nit+ is not a variable, it is a
method, in other words a function or subroutine, depending on your
dialect.

*Alice*: Without parentheses?

*Bob*: Without parentheses!  This is a method without arguments.
So why put parentheses around nothing?

*Alice*: But in any language I have worked with, if a fuction
+do_something+ has no arguments, you still have to invoke it with
<tt>do_something()</tt>.  Otherwise how will the compiler know that
it is dealing with a function, sorry, method, rather than a variable?

*Bob*: The compilers of the languages you are familiar with cannot.
But here we are dealing with a really _smart_ language.

*Alice*: You mean the Ruby compiler can figure out . . . 

*Bob*: . . . the Ruby interpreter, you mean . . .

*Alice*: . . . ah yes, the Ruby interpreter, how can it figure out
when a name stands for a variable and when it stands for a method?

*Bob*: Ruby will look around within the proper context, in this case
within the body of the class definition we are in . . .

*Alice*: . . . the body of +Body+ you mean . . . 

*Bob*: . . . yes, names can get confusing, even for human interpreters.
And the Ruby interpreter will then see a statement <tt>def e_init</tt>,
and will realize that the name <tt>e_init</tt> pertains to a method.

*Alice*: How elegant.

*Bob*: Indeed.  Of course, you are perfectly free to write <tt>e_init()</tt>
instead, if you like, but I prefer brevity.  So this third line of +evolve+
invokes the methode +e_init+ below.  We'll look at that in a moment, but
all it does is to compute the total energy of the system at the beginning
of a run, and stores the value in an internal variable, so that we can
compare the energy at a later time with the initial value, to see how much
the energy has drifted.

The next line invokes the method +write_diagnostics+, which does
exactly what its name says.  It has two arguments, +nsteps+ and +time+,
since those two counters have been defined locally within the body of
the +evolve+ method, and therefore they are not visible outside that
method.  I want +write_diagnostics+ to write those numbers as well, so
I have to pass them explicitly.

*Alice*: You could of course have defined them as internal variables
for the +Body+ class, how did you call them again?  Ah, instance variables.

*Bob*: Yes, but that would be confusing and potentially dangerous.  The
+Body+ class is growing bigger now, so I don't like to have an unnecessary
proliferation of internal variables that float around inside, visible for
every function.  Debugging then becomes much harder.  There is a reason
that the human body has cells and that cells have cell walls and that
within a cell there is the membrane around the nucleus as well as a variety
of other compartmentalized structures.

*Alice*: See, that is what I mean when I insist on modular programming.

*Bob*: If so, I agree with you on this level.  The problem I had with your
earlier descriptions was that you seemed to want to compartmentalize on
higher levels as well.  I am glad that each cell of my body does not share
its contents with every other cell.  But I would be unhappy if my left hand
would not know what my right hand would be doing.  And even though I don't
like to put my foot in my mouth, I'm glad I have the freedom to do so!

*Alice*: We'll come back to that.  For now, I'm glad we're in agreement
about modularity on a local level.  While creating larger programs, we will
move up to more global issues, and there we can fight things out with
concrete examples.  Meanwhile, I'll try not to tease you any longer about
modularity.  This code looks already as modular as you can ask for.

== Keeping Time

*Bob*: Moving right along, we see three lines of assignment.  Here I set
up a book keeping process that will tell us when we need to take some
action other than integrating.  The variable +t_dia+ stores the next time
at which we want to report energy diagnostics.  Initially we set it equal
to the time interval between diagnostics output, which is +dt_dia+.  Later
on during the integration, there may be many times at which you want to
see the energy being reported.  Each time that is done, the variable +t_dia+
is updated to the subsequent diagnostics output time, as we will see in a
moment.  So first we have a trivial looking <tt>t_dia = dt_dia</tt>, but
after the first output <tt>t_dia</tt> will be changed to <tt>2dt_dia</tt>,
then to <tt>3dt_dia</tt>, and so on, until the integration finishes.

In a similar way, the variable +t_out+ stores the time at which the next
particle output will be done, <i>i.e.</i> the time at which we print the
mass, position, and velocity of the relative motion.  The mass will
not change, of course, although we could introduce mass losing stars
or even exploding stars at some point later on.  But the position and
velocity will change, as we have seen.  Sometimes we may be interested
in getting frequent output of these numbers, for example when we will
make a movie of a particle motion, as we will do soon.  At other occasions
we may be more interested in studying the energy drift with a fine comb.
So by having +dt_out+ and +dt_dia+ as free dials to determing the output
frequency of of positions and velocities on the one hand, and the energy
on the other hand, gives us a lot of flexibility.

The variable +t_end+ is similar to the other two I just discussed, except
that it will not be updated during the integration: when +t_end+ is first
reached, that will be the end . . . 

*Alice*: . . . of a single call to +evolve+.  I presume that you can give
repeated calls to the +evolve+ method, from your driver, if you chose to
do so.

*Bob*: Indeed.  But each time you invoke +evolve+, everything starts from
scratch again within the body of +evolve+; the +evolve+ method itself has
no idea whether it has been called before or not.  It just does its thing,
starting with what it thinks is time zero.

*Alice*: So if you call +evolve+ twice, the time is set back to zero
in between.

*Bob*: For now, yes.  That just was the simplest way to implement it.
Time is used here only internally, for bookkeeping during a single
invocation of +evolve+.  Of course, I could have introduced a time
variable on the level of the driver.  But then I would have to pass
that also to +evolve+ and I thought that four arguments was enough for
a first attempt.  Anything can be made arbitrarily complex quickly, and
I like to keep things simple.

*Alice*: That makes a lot of sense.  So all we have left to look at within
+evolve+ is the +while+ loop, which keeps track of time.  When the time
+time+ exceeds the value of +t_end+, the method stops and control is
handed back to the driver, which called +evolve+.

*Bob*: Indeed.  And the first thing that happens is a call to +evolve_step+.
Like +evolve+, it integrates the orbit of our particle, but only for one
step.

*Alice*: Divide and conquer.

*Bob*: Yes, the level of +evolve+ is pure management; all the footwork is
down by +evolve_step+, step for step.

== More Brevity

*Alice*: In the next line, the time gets updated, by the amount of time
that was spent while stepping our particle forward by one step, and
similarly the +nsteps+ counter is increased by one.  I see what happens
next.  Unless there is an immediate need to do a form of output, for
energy of particle positions and velocities, we just move on.  And in
those cases where you do an output, you immediately schedule the next
output, by increasing the future output time by the corresponding output
interval.

*Bob*: Indeed.  And that's it!  Then next method we have seen before:

 :inccode: .body.rb+evolve_step

Newton in action: the acceleration is calculated and both position and
velocity are updated.

*Alice*: Using this coordinate-free notation.  I love it.  It is so compact!
Like a minicar that you love to drive in a crowded city.

*Bob*: Wait till you get to the diagnostics method, you'll love that even
more.  But first we have three short methods.  The first two calculate
the kinetic and potential energy for the relative motion:

 :inccode: .body.rb+ekin

 :inccode: .body.rb+epot

*Alice*: You can just read them off, kinetic energy quadratic in velocity,
potential energy proportional to inverse distance.  Wonderful.  One-liners
are great.

*Bob*: Note that both +ekin+ and +epot+ are methods, not variables, just
like the method we already saw earlier, +e_init+:

 :inccode: .body.rb+e_init

As long as this function is called responsibly, <i>i.e.</i> only at
the beginning of the integration, the internal variable <tt>@e0</tt>
will be set to the initial sum of the kinetic and potential energy, in
other words to the total initial energy.

*Alice*: That is funny, that you can just add +ekin+ and +epot+, as if
they were variables, even though they are really functions.

== Ruby Smiling

*Bob*: Yes, but as I promised you, it is getting even better.  Look at the
first line in the method that does the output for our energy diagnostics:

 :inccode: .body.rb+write_diagnostics

*Alice*: It reads <tt>etot = ekin + epot</tt>.  Yes, of course, the total
energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy.  But wait, the
first variable +etot+ must be a local variable, local to the body of the
method +write_diagnostics+, while +ekin+ and +epot+ are methods.  That
is remarkable!  It seems as if we are freely mixing nouns and verbs,
and yet everything looks so natural, and I presume it does the right
thing.

*Bob*: It does, yes, I did test it.

*Alice*: How _very_ elegant!

*Bob*: I knew you would like this line in particular.  And I was wondering
what grandiose philosophical explanation you would connect with it.

*Alice*: Easy!  It shows that Ruby is a natural kind of language, almost
a natural language.  In English, you mix nouns and verbs in one sentence
without having to think at the start of each sentence how to connect them.
You just talk, because you have become familiar with them.  In contrast,
in a language like C++ you can `talk' in it for years, and still you have
to look up the rules of the game, each time you do something new.  I've
never felt a natural familiarity with C++, no matter how much I have used
it.  And here, how can you not love Ruby, with <tt>etot = ekin + epot</tt>
smiling at you!

*Bob*: You have a point there, Ruby does feel comfortable, like a natural
language, or an old shoe.

*Alice*: You're mixing metaphors, but I know what you mean.  Well, let's
see what you did with the total energy that you so magically created.
You are sending something to the standard error stream, yes?

*Bob*: That's what you would call it in C++, indeed.  We have seen that
+print+ directs output to the standard output stream, by default.  But
by calling +STDERR+ 's +print+ method, we are now sending the string
that follows it to the standard error stream.

*Alice*: Why do you send positions and velocities to the standard ouput
channel, and the energy diagnostics to the error channel?  Because you
expect errors in your energy?

*Bob*: Very funny.  No, because I may want to separate the two streams,
later on.  In order to make a graphics movie, for example, we could
output the positions every timestep, or every ten time steps or so.
If we then would ask for energy diagnostics only occasionally, the
diagnostics information would get completely lost in the middle of all
that other ouput.  Besides, the graphics reader could get confused,
if it expected only particle data.

Of course you can work around all that with a little awking and grepping,
but it is cleaner to separatings things right at the start.  In that way,
you can redirect the standard output to a file, while letting the
diagnostics appear on your screen.  Or you can put both types of
output into separate files.

*Alice*: I agree completely.  You are locally modular!  I won't tease
you anymore.

*Bob*: Only praise me?  That's fine, that I don't mind at all.

== A Here Document

*Alice*: While I get the idea of what you want to print out, in the
statement starting with <tt>STDERR.print</tt>, I'm completely confused
by what follows on the next few lines.  Here, let me have the key board,
and let me at least properly indent it, it hurts my eyes.

*Bob*: No, stop, don't do that!  It has a meaning.

*Alice*: Meaning?

*Bob*: I'm glad emacs has an undo.  Yes, meaning.  The funny symbols
<tt><<END</tt> indicate the beginning of what is called a "here document".

*Alice*: As opposed to a "there document"?

*Bob*: It is really called like that, and for a good reason.
