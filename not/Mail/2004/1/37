Hi Jun:

I incorporated your addition to chapter 2.  It works fine, so now we
have all the tools I can think of (right now at least) to write
several chapters for our book!

By the way, when I first implemented your :commandinputoutput: it
didn't work, because I had a few blank spaces after the endtag; I had
written "END  " instead of "END".  To allow such a usage, I changed
your line in acsdoc:

    until (line= ifile.gets.chomp) == endtag

to:

    until (line= ifile.gets.chomp) =~ /#{endtag}/

That did the job with and without extra spaces.

Piet
