= Chapter 1.  Setting the Stage

Two astronomers meet each other over tea, one afternoon.

*Alice*: Hi Bob, what are you up to?

*Bob*: Well, to be honest, I'm not quite sure yet.  I've just about
wrapped up the two main projects that have occupied my attention for
the last few years.  <p>shall we say which projects?</p>  It's nice to
sit back for a bit, looking at the whole field of astronomy, before
plunging into a new project.

*A*: Actually, I'm in a similar situation.  Since I moved here, a
month ago, I've been dealing with all kind of chores that had been
accumulating, but now I have a clean desk, and I'm ready to start up.
So I'm in a similar situation.

*B*: The previous time I felt like this was when I had handed in my
thesis.  I was surprised to find myself suddenly in a pleasant vacuum,
after rushing so much to get everything finished in time.  It was soon
afterwards that I started working on xxx.  <p>let's think of something
interesting here</p>  That was six years ago.

*A*: I heard you just got tenure.  I guess that has something to do
with your finishing up your two projects?

*B*: how did you guess ;>).  While I enjoyed my work, I did feel a
little constrained.  There were times that I would have loved to go in
some other directions, but that probably would not have been wise to
do at that point.

*A*: I think you made the right decision.  When I got tenure, about
ten years ago now, I was in a different situation.  We were in the
middle of xxxx <p>how about a large project in cosmology?</p>, and we
were really excited about gettings things figured out.  But by now
the standard model is pretty well understood, and cosmology has become
a rather ordinary field in astronomy.  Frankly, this was one of the
reasons that I decided to move here, to get a fresh perspective, and
perhaps to start working in a new area.

*B*: So we are in comparable situations then.  Well, what are your plans.
Are you thinking of moving out of cosmology altogether?

*A*: I'm not sure yet.  The next phase of progress in cosmology is
likely to come from a detailed understanding of the formation of stars
and galaxies.  But given the difficulty of those topics, and the large
theoretical uncertainties that go into even the best models, this
phase may last a long time.  Twenty years may be a lower limit.

*B*: For sure.  If you see how long people have been working on these
problems already, and how slow the progress has been, I would bet on
thirty years, at least, before our theoretical models can really predict
how stars and galaxies form under given conditions in the interstellar
and intergalactic medium.

*A*: While the physics is interesting, the simulations seem to be
riddled with all kind of ad hoc assumptions, which makes you wonder
what to believe from any particular attempt at modeling.

<p>from here on, they then conclude that dense stellar systems are
actually doable, already on the level of stellar dynamics, and to some
extent on the level of stellar evolution and hydro.  While the last
two are still uncertain, perhaps it would be worth while to make such
a clear and clean simulation environment that at least you can bracket
all uncertains in a reliable and reproducable way.  And then you might
be able to use the wealth of observational data to constrain
simultaneously all the theoretical uncertainties.  Shall we say
something like this?</p>

Perhaps they talk a bit more about the nature of simulations.

Perhaps they make a rough outline of what a big project could be like.

<p>We'll have to make it natural and believable that they commit
themselves to a many-year project; otherwise it would not make sense
for them to spend a lot of time on designing mechanisms for lab notes
and docbook and all that.  Do you have suggestions of how to present
that?</p>

They then decide to get together the next day to get started.
