Indeed very similar to our experiences!  And rdoc is far easier to use
than XML, for sure.  It is interesting, though, that Dave Thomas at
the end mentions that he does like XML for book writing:

  Dave Thomas: If you're talking about using XML in certain domains,
  it's fine. XSLT, for example, lets you do some really fun things with
  XML. When we had our book online, for example, we went from LaTeX, to
  XML, and then to the output format, simply because XSLT gave us some
  really powerful ways for manipulating the document's content. XML is
  useful in appropriate contexts, but it is being grossly abused in most
  of the ways it is being used today.

We, too, will have to decide later what to do.  And of course, for I/O
it will be good to use XML format, at the very least, and either our
own I/O interpreter or more likely an existing Ruby-XML parser.
