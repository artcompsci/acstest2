== Lab note web update scheme memo

The basic scheme is to run update-acslab as cron scheduled command on
grape, which is both svn and web server:

 [acs@grape ~/bin]$ crontab -l
 "* * * * *       /usr2/acs/bin/update-acslab"

It does not seem like updating svn repository correctly after getting
a mail. Need to be fixed.

Adding local files (like this file) seems okay.
