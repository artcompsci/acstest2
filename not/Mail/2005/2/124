Hi Jun:

Greetings from Kyoto.
Here is the summary of our discussions on Monday, 2005/2/21:

I will give each directory a new (logical) name,
instead of the current vol-xx names.

In the directory $ACSROOT/kali/vol we will create two new files:

-- one contains the information of the current volume numbers;
   this information is read from the kali home page, and is then
   automagically converted to the table in this new file.  This
   information is then used in each directory, to write the
   correct volume number on the title pages of the volumes, etc.

-- another file will contain the dependency of the volumes,
   which volume needs knowledge of which other volume, in a type
   of particl ordering (semi-ordering), like multiple inheritance.
   This information will be used to automagically generate a type
   of flow diagram, a graph that shows all dependencies, using
   either abbreviated names of volumes and/or volume numbers from
   the previous file.

Another question we discussed was the question of how to implement
pathname magic for library files.  I must say, I find this the
most difficult, and I hope that you can find a way to make some
sort of preliminary version for this.

Good luck implementing these!

Meanwhile, I'll be writing the (first) volume on world1.rb, etc.

Cheers,

Piet
