	* Prepare for V1.0

	* Fix problem where install script thought Darwin was a
	  Windows box.

	* Add smart quotes, but then comment it out because many
  	  browsers seem not to support the characters.  Give it a
	  couple of months...

	* Support :nodoc: for alias and attrs

	* Comments are now preserved across 'private', 'protected',
 	  and 'public'

	* "class << Constant" now appends to an existing class if it
	  can find one.

	* Alises are now supported

	* The new :args: method modifier allows you to override the
	  argument list

	* new --include-line-numbers command line option

	* Support tabs. Add --tab-width command line option.

	* The :title: and :main: top-level modifiers allow you to set
	  options from inside source files

	* The :doc: modifier forces documentation of otherwise
	  undocumented methods.

	* Various bug fixes


2002-07-22      beta-2

        * Bil Kleb has started work on a Fortran 95 parser.

	* Patches from Mike Witrant to support .cc files, and to fix
	  some bugs in C parsing. Added experimental code for
	  extracting C method bodies.

        * Werner Neubauer added a whole lot of new diagramming
          support, so it now draws module relationships. He also fixed
          a number of bugs in my code

	* Reorganized parsers to make it easier to add new ones 

        * Bug fixes:

        - see Changelog...



2002-03-30      beta-1

	* Templates now resolve symbol names using scopes, so we no
	  longer have the problem with resolving inner names in nested
	  constructs. Fix up the various templates accordingly. While
	  we're in there, reduce the space after a method name in the
	  standard HTML template.

	* Add support for .chm file generation


2002-03-03      alpha-c  (alpha-b was a faulty release)

	* Add xml support (--fmt xml). Reorganize the template
  	  directories.  Add the -one-file option (currently only
  	  useful for XML).

        * Add RDF generation.

	* Add support for parsing C extensions.

	* Add support for SimpleMarkup-only files (any file not .rb
	  or .c) which contain just a block comment.

        * Add contrib/ directory. Currently contains David Alan
          Black's alpha release of Formatting Object support, allowing
          RDoc to generate PDF, Postscript etc.

        * New options:

	  o Add --exclude option, which prevents file and directories
	    matching a pattern from being included in the
	    documentation.

	  o Add --inline-source option to allow source code to be
	    included in the body of the document, and not in popups.

	  o Added --charset option.

	  o Diagram image format now selectable using the
	    --image_format option.

          o --opname sets the name of the output (for formatters that
            need it)

	* Add support for link: hyperlinks. These are hyperlinks to
	  local files, assumed tobe relative to the --op directory.

	* Force auto-generated ::new method to be public, and added
	  :notnew: directive to prevent automatic conversion of
	  #initialize into ::new.

	* Drop the font size of <pre> down to 1.1em.

	* Sort list of classes and modules in the summary page.

	* Fixed various parsing issues (see ChangeLog).


2002-02-10      alpha-a

	* Fixed compatibility problem with latest 1.7

        * Diagram feature now draws fileboxes (optionally, see --filebox
        parameter). Thanks to Sergey

        * If a comment contains a '#fred' cross reference, we now
         remove the '#' unless the new --show-hash option is given

	* Thanks to Niklas Frykolm, Gunnar Andersson, and Thomas
          Hurst, we're now closer to generating conformant HTML.

        * added diagram support to kilmer template

        * Add support for client-side imagemaps in class diagrams, based on
	a method from Tony Smith.

        * Method and classe name title added to source popup window.

	* Change handling of initial comment. Now a blank line will
        terminate the initial comment.

        * Arbitrary files can not be generated from templates. This
          means that is a template needs to write (say) a .css file,
          or a bitmap, the process can be encapsulated within the
          template itself.

        * Numerous bug fixes:
          - parsing of symbols whose names are reserved words
          - parsing of while/until with a 'do'
          - made all filesnames valid under DOS
          - fix end of line handling under DOS
          - use IO.popen to validate 'dot', avoiding a cygwin bug
          - fix finding templates when RDoc is run without being
            installed
          - fixed bug that failed to interpret '<<' as a method name
          - Bil Kleb fixed _many_ typos
          - fixed some formatting problems with NS4.7


2002-01-24      alpha-9

        * added --help option.

	* Jah of Enticla added wonderful support for diagramming
	  classes and modules. Added new -d option to turn it on, and
	  renamed the debug option -D.

	* Added support for generating the blank page needed as the
          initial src= in the source frame.

	* The body of labeled lists can now start on the line
	  following the label, thus avoiding those hideously indented
	  blocks. This means you can write:

             This is my very long label::
                And this is the body of the list entry. See it
                glisten in the noon-day sun.

	* Added --template option and the ability to switch html
	  output templates. Included the 'kilmer' template from
          Rich Kilmer.


2002-01-16      alpha-8


        * :nodoc: in the file-level comment turns off documentation
          for the file (but classes and modules in the file are still
          documented).

        * The sequence '#++' turns documentation back on after a '#--'
          turns it off.

        * Added --title option.


2002-01-13      alpha-7

	* :include: directive and the --include command line option
          allows text from other files to be inserted incomment blocks:

              # and the it outputs the result.
              # :include: copyright

	* The :nodoc: modifier can appear after class, module, and
	  method declarations. It stops information from that
	  syntactic unit appearing in the output. With the 'all'
	  option, it also prevents the output of included sub modules
	  and classes.

	* Horizontal rules (denoted by three or more hyphens) are
	  supported. The more hyphens, the thicker the rule.

	* Hyperlinks to the web (http,mailto, and ftp) are
	  recognized. Links to images become inline <img> tags.

	* The generated HTML is now simpler and more compact. The
	  output is cleaner.

	* The Parent class is now shown as a hyperlink if possible.

	* RDoc can now be invoked conveniently from a program

	* Add --quiet option

	* RDoc now stops processing comments when it sees a line
	  containing '#--'. This allows you to have internal comments
	  and external comments in one block.
