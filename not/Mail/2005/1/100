Hi Piet,

The following is a demonstration of the using "extend" method to
change the behavior of the objects of the same class.

  module A
    def pp
      print "Hellow, I am A\n"
    end
  end
  
  module B
    def pp
      print "Hellow, I am B\n"
    end
  end
  
  module C
    def pp
      print "Hellow, I am C\n"
    end
  end
  
  class Body
    include A
  end
  
  a = Body.new
  
  print "Original a: "
  a.pp
  a.extend(B)
  print "Extended a (with B): "
  a.pp
  
  b = Body.new
  
  print "New b: "
  b.pp
  b.extend(C)
  print "Extended b (with C): "
  b.pp
  
  c = Body.new
  
  print "a, b and c:\n"
  a.pp
  b.pp
  c.pp

  --- sample output --- 
  <yebisu:/home/makino/src/rubyutils>ruby test.rb
  Original a: Hellow, I am A
  Extended a (with B): Hellow, I am B
  New b: Hellow, I am A
  Extended b (with C): Hellow, I am C
  a, b and c:
  Hellow, I am B
  Hellow, I am C
  Hellow, I am A
