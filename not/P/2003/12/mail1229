 Hi Jun:
 
 Thanks for all your comments!  I'll address them in the next emails.
 Meanwhile another thought:
 
 We normally talk about Gflops and Tflops with "s" for "per second".
 But we could also talk about the total number of floating point operations
 for a given calculation.  For example, you may be the first person who has
 done an Eflop simulation (10^18 flops; a few months on 0.1 Tflops), in the
 mid nineties.
 
 The next mile stone will be a Zflop, a zetta floating point operations,
 10^21 flop.  With a system running at 50 Tflops, this will take almost
 eight months.  So maybe you will have to wait till the GRAPE-8.  Or it
 might just be possible on the current GRAPE-6 cluster.
 
 Just a thought!  It would be a nice title for a paper:
 The first Zettaflop calculation.
 
 On a related topic, we have been talking about Holger doing core collapse
 calculations for larger N values, perhaps starting from an isothermal
 sphere, and watching a few core oscillations, maybe even for half a million
 particles, or up to a million.  Shall we ping Holger about that?
 Do you think this will be interesting, and if so, do you have a suggestion
 for what to suggest to him to do?
 Also, it might be possible to do core collapse from more regular initial
 conditions for 128k and 256k.
 
 Piet

 Fine.  Let's see.  How about "vol" for volumes?
 
 In that case, shall we have a subdirectory vol/volume1 ?
 
 Perhaps we can call the current book volume 1, if this is the first book
 in which two professor start talking and working together.  The more
 introductory books can be written in a different way, and perhaps with
 a different numbering?  Or would you prefer to have a continuous numbering?
 
 For example, we could call the `professor series' "The Art of Computational
 Science" and the `student series' something like "Introduction to
 Computational Science" or "Introduction to Stellar Dynamics" or . . .
 
 By the way, just before that, I mentioned "log".  Shall we delete that,
 since it no longer seems to be necessary?  Or is it still?

 Hi Jun:
 
 By the way, after I sent you the email below, I realized that I forgot
 to svn the script I wrote.  I did indeed put it in acs/bin, but I did
 not commit it yet.  But since you mentioned that it should not go to
 acs/bin, where shall I put it?  Or would it be better not to commit it?
 
 As for the "raise" problem which I mentioned, how do you think we should
 change that?
 
 By the way, here is the script:
 
 #!/usr/bin/ruby
 #
 #  svn_local_list.rb
 #
 #  you can run this script in any directory under svn (subversion) control,
 #  to obtain the list of files that are partu of svn, even those files that
 #  have been added, but not yet committed.
 #
 #  usage: ruby svn_local_list.rb
 #
 #==============================================================================
 
 fname = ".svn/entries"
 if FileTest.exist?(fname)
   entry_file = open(fname, "r")
 else
   print "The current directory is not under subversion control\n"
   exit
 end
 while s = entry_file.gets
   if s =~ /name=\"/
     file_name = $'
     file_name.chop!                                        # remove trailing \n
     file_name.chop!                                        # remove trailing "
     unless file_name == "svn:this_dir"
       print file_name, "\n"
     end
   end
 end

 Subject: listing local svn files without internet connection
 
 Hi Jun:
 
 I wrote a script `svn_local_list.rb' which I can run without internet
 connection, to see which files are under svn control.  I put that in
 "ACS/bin".  Is that the right place to put it, do you think, or can
 you think of a better place?
 
 Also, shouldn't we place "$ACSROOT/src/labnotes/update-lab" in "ACS/bin"?
 And how about "$ACSROOT/src/coherent_programming/acsdoc.rb" ?
 
 By the way, in my first version of this script, I started with:
 
   unless entry_file = open(".svn/entries","r")
     raise "The current directory is not under subversion control"
   end
 
 However, this does not do the proper error handling.  I used the same format
 as what you used in "combine-notes.rb", but when I tried to run my script in
 a directory that is not under svn control, I got a real error message that
 was never captured by this "raise" command (it responded with:
 
    /home/piet/acs/bin/svn_local_list.rb:13:in `open': 
      No such file or directory - ".svn/entries" (Errno::ENOENT)
 	from /home/piet/acs/bin/svn_local_list.rb:13
 
 without ever seeing the second line with "raise" in it.  So I changed the
 first three lines above to
 
    fname = ".svn/entries"
    if FileTest.exist?(fname)
      entry_file = open(fname, "r")
    else
      print "The current directory is not under subversion control\n"
      exit
    end
 
 This is actually nicer, because it does not give any error message;
 in a way it is more appropriate to just print the message without
 shouting on the error stream ;>).
 Anyway, I guess this means that we have to use a different form of
 error handling in "combine-notes.rb" and "acsdoc.rb" as well.

 That is fine, but it would be nice to have a natural and systematic
 way to look at the todo files regularly.  After all, there is so much
 to do, and we have so little time, that it is rather important that we
 work mostly on the most important things.  In other words, it is important
 to have clear priorities.
 
 Right now, we determine our prorities in a variety of ways, by talking
 with each other, by writing email, by mentioning things in lab notes;
 if we also have a number of different places where we write todo notes,
 I wonder how we can remind ourselves where to look when.
 
 Similarly, we may want to have a place or a mechanism for bug reports.
 Right now that is not yet much of an issue, but soon it will be.
 
 Do you have suggestions for setting up some sort of todo mechanism and
 bug reports mechanism?  Perhaps they can appear together somewhere?
 Having them in multiple places is fine too, if we can think of a good
 way to let them point easily at each other.

 I see your point.  Okay!  That would also be more general perhaps,
 since my use of <i> for italic may be confusing, if someone uses
 another <i> inside the memo form.
 
 How would you like to implement this?

 Thanks, Jun, for checking what I started writing in chapters 1 and 2.
 
 Chapter 1:

 Good idea!  I'll write something along those lines.
 
 Chapter 2:
 
 > [Piet, I think the selection of the language comes after we did some
 > experiments, writing things in fortran, C and something else, or at
 > least after discussing on the possibility of using them. 
 
 Yes, that makes sense.  I agree.
 
 The main question is: how much do we want to write about that, a few
 pages, a chapter, several chapters?  Do we actually want to provide a
 code in Fortran and in C, perhaps the nbody_sh1.C code and its Fortran
 equivalent?  That would be fine, of course, but it would make a big
 difference in how I would write the text, so it would be good to
 decide that right now, before I write more.
 
 I'm not sure what is the best way.  If it were for a student book,
 then I would prefer to start with ruby right away, since it is so much
 simpler.  Since we start by introducing a professor dialogue, it makes
 sense to assume that they have experience with fortran and/or C, but
 even so, they may decide to start a new project in ruby, given that
 they have heard good things about it (perhaps they read the IBM web
 page you pointed out; we can certainly refer to that!).
 
 On the other hand, if we start with C++, we can recycle several
 chapters of the previous book.  However, then it will be a loooong
 time before we get to ruby.  And for Fortran people, to have to go
 through long chapter(s) on C++, which is new to them, and then a long
 chapter(s) on ruby, which is also new to them, may just be too
 frustrating, right from the beginning.
 
 What do you think?

 I had not thought about that, but you are right.  It would be
 unnatural for scientists to start from scratch, without first looking
 what is available.
 
 Hmmm.  We can have a dialogue about somebody trying to install starlab
 and giving up in disgust (translating Douglas' friendly gentleman
 comments into stronger American language ;>).  Hmm, perhaps not :(.
 
 More seriously, we have to decide what their background is.
 
 Option 1: they are relatively new to stellar dynamics, but they do
           have experience in other fields.  This is how I started the
           dialogue.  This is perhaps rather unrealistic, though, and we
           would have to offer a strong explanation for why they want to
           write their own environment.
 
 Option 2: they are familiar with stellar dynamics, they have gone to
           modest meetings perhaps, but they finally conclude that they
           have to build their own system.  This will be much closer to
           our own case, of course.  Shall we do that?  But then it will
           be more complicated to write a story.  We will have to say
           at least a bit in some detail about what they have done in
           the past, what type of experience they got with which
           package on which projects.  The easiest would be just to
           take ourselves!  But that would make *A* and *B* just be
           Piet and Jun, it would be too transparent, and we may as
           well then write the dialogue between us.  Hmmmmm.  Do you
           have some suggestions?

 Fine!  I'm happy to write about all that, after we have decided the
 two issues above:
 
 -- whether to include C++ and/or Fortran code before Ruby code;
 
 -- how to describe the background of Alice and Bob.  
 
 Depending on the answers to those issues, we can decide how to solve
 the VERY tricky political questions, especially with respect to starlab....

 Since the force calculation method is so large, it is perhaps better
 to use your second option, to make that a separate include file.
 
 I guess what we need here is what you described in your notes over the
 weekend; I read those at home yesterday evening, out of email contact.
 I very much like the idea of nested include segments.
 
 It would be great if you could implement that idea, whenever you have
 some time.  It seems that the best division of labour is now for me
 to write the dialogues for a few chapters, and for you to improve the
 rdoc system, for our needs.  Would that be okay?
 
 By the way, I could set my browser up in such a way that I could read
 the Japanese in your weekend notes.  At some point I can try to see
 whether I can use the system you gave me to write in Japanese as well ;>).

 Hi Jun:
 
 This is my last message for today.  I'm sorry to send so many emails,
 but it is easier to reply to shorter ones with a specific topic, I think.
 Do you agree?
 
 In the future, we probably do not have to send so many emails.  Right now,
 we are still very much in a start-up phase, where we have a number of
 important decisions to make, but soon, I hope, we'll get into a more
 steady state of chapter writing and code writing.
 
 For now, shall we continue to communicate this way, as I just did today,
 or do you prefer that I would write my comments all in lab notes?
 
 Somehow email is a bit easier for direct questions, because you can
 quote a few sentences and react directly.
 
 However, there is a drawback too.  All the email that you and I have
 exchanged yesterday and today is now outside the lab notes.  Would you
 like me to add these emails to the lab notes?  I can simply write them
 out and add them all as one contribution, even though that's a bit bulky.
 
 What do you prefer?
 
 Piet

 Hi Jun:
 
 I just read your latest lab notes.  By the way, the dates for your
 labnotes show up as "EST" not "JST" in my browser.  Is there an easy
 way to make my system now that it should be JST?

 Interesting idea, but how can we combine that with rdoc?
 Would you see this as a replacement for rdoc?

 Very nice, thanks!
 
 I guess that the next line below is a different topic?  Would you mind
 writing a few words as a title for each topic?  That will make it easier

 Yes, that is very nice, I like that approach.  I had not thought about
 .xxx.rb-segment_name, that is a great idea.  I guess you want to
 generate those automatically, from directives written as comments in
 the ruby code?  That would be a good solution.
 
 And yes, I had noticed that it seems (almost) impossible to pass HTML
 commands through rdoc.  There must be a mechanism, but I haven't
 figured it out yet.  And yes, after some struggling over the weekend,
 I finally discovered, too, that offset with empty space from the left
 margin suddenly makes everything being formatted in equal-spaced way,
 obeying carriage returns.  Only after that did I realize it was in the
 manual, but written in almost ununderstandable way...

 I think it would be okay to do so.  The important thing is that it is
 XML compliant.  It may be a good thing to make all our innovations as
 much as possible look like XML.  Then when someone makes a rdoc-2-XML
 translator, probably soon(ish), perhaps our constructions can survive
 that transition.
 
 So I would vote for doing what you described.  But just to make sure,
 do you see another option, which would keep compatibility with rdoc?

 That makes sense: "series" suggests an array of books.  "web" is nice,
 but both Knuth and www have already overloaded that word.  A "collection"
 of books would suggest too little structure, like a simple set.  In fact,
 category theory would be a better metaphor; but a "category" of books
 sounds too strange.  Hmmm.  How about a "cluster" of books?  Or do you
 have another suggestion?
 
 >  So in principle we can just have book titles.
 
 Okay.  I guess we will stick to "moving stars around", yes?
 What about our current book?  (moving astronmers around?  No, too honest ;>).
 
 It may be good to write one book for each new release.  So then each
 book would get a number x.y and a title.
 
 The current book could be: "ACS 0.1: Designing a Computational Lab"
 
 Alternative titles:
 
 -- Coherent Programming (too general, too vague?)
 -- Laying the Foundations for a Computational Lab (too long?)
 -- Stellar Dynamics with Individual Time Steps (ignores lab aspects)
 -- Designing a Laboratory for Dense Stellar Systems (too early?)
 
 The last title could be given to a later book perhaps.
 
 What do you think?
 
 > Also, I guess "The art" basically covers everything. We could have
 > something like advanced course, introductory course etc.
 
 Good point; I was wondering about that myself, after I suggested it.

 A very nice idea!  Normally, this would be bad programming, for two
 reasons: the underlying language is too complicated to understand a
 script immediately and the compiler is too stupid to explain clearly
 what is going on.  In ruby neither of these two problems are there.
 
 So yes, let us keep it simple.

 That doesn't sound right, since a script to check which files are
 under svn control is much more general than src/coherent_programming;
 it can be used in any subdirectory of acs.
 
 It think it either should appear in a more general acs directory (if
 so, where?) or it should be outside acs altogether.  I'm happy to put
 it in my own personal bin for example, but I just wondered whether it
 would not be nice to present it as a useful tool -- for example, in
 the dialogue in the book, it could show up.  If so, perhaps it should
 just go then wherever the code for that chapter would go.
 
 What is your preference?

 Good idea.  How about also putting TODO there, under the not/ directory,

 That is a nice suggestion.  I thought you meant to implement that in
 our extension to rdoc.  I agree with you that this is much clearer than
 <j> ... </j>.
 
 Or do you mean that it would be even better to write directly into the

 some mistakes, and then find out how to correct them, so that the

 I could argue either way.  But I don't feel strongly about it.
 So I'm happy to follow your suggestion.
 
 But in that case, it might be best to first present the Fortran code,
 and then the C++ code.
 
 However, in that case, it might be better to do a better job using C++,
 including classes with operator overloading, for several reasons:
 
 -- otherwise Fortran people may think that C++ is rather trivial;
 -- otherwise C++ people may think that we are unfair, comparing the
      use of classes in ruby with C++ without classes.
 
 Perhaps the best thing would be to introduce three versions of the code:
 
 1) in Fortran
 2) in C
 3) in C++
 
 The current C++ code "nbody_sh1.C" can be rewritten in C very simply;
 it almost does not use any C++ after all.

 That's a very nice idea!  You can add an email account to acs.org,
 perhaps "not@acs.org", which is forwarded to both you and me (and to
 other developers in the future), and also will wind up in the log files.
 I don't know how easy it is to do that automatically, perhaps generating
 a file starting with "." also, in lab note mode, or in a slightly different
 way?  Would you like to try to set that up?  That would be great!

 Hi Jun:
 
 In the middle of all the emails, I guess you didn't respond to the one
 below yet.  Did you mean to combine Wiki and rdoc, or split stuff up
 between them, or replace rdoc by Wiki?

 Subject: lab notes by Jun, Saturday, Dec. 26
 
 Hi Jun:
 
 I just read your latest lab notes.  By the way, the dates for your
 labnotes show up as "EST" not "JST" in my browser.  Is there an easy
 way to make my system now that it should be JST?

 Interesting idea, but how can we combine that with rdoc?
 Would you see this as a replacement for rdoc?

 Okay, would you like to do that?  Then I'll pick it up with svn.
 
 We probably should have one README file (or READMETOO file) which
 explains exactly what we have changed, including the type of diffs
 you showed in your email, so that we can adapt more easily with the
 next update.

 Sorry, I was refering to the line:
 
 > > > <memo Peter>  nemo snapshot is better </memo>
 
 That is a nice suggestion.  I thought you meant to implement that in
 our extension to rdoc.  I agree with you that this is much clearer than
 <j> ... </j>.
 
 Or do you mean that it would be even better to write directly into the
 file "[<i> ... - Jun]" and not use <memo Jun> . . . </memo> ?
 
 Sorry, communication by email is a lot more complicated that in person :>).
