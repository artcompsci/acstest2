Hi Jun:

Here is a new todo list, of points that we should address before
the summer school, ideally before the end of April:

* code management

  -- Jun's new start at implementation (Jun's mail, 15 Feb '05)

  -- shall we install a systematic set of test suites everywhere?

* links between volumes

  -- implement Jun's suggestion (Jun's mail, 07 Feb '05)

* History mechanism

  -- implement Piet's suggestion (Jun's mail, 07 Feb '05) + svn version number

  -- do we need to implement a special story mechanism?

* Wiki

  -- create a framework for students to show their codes

* speed-up

  -- start with a simple version, or directly with world4.rb?

* graphics

  -- make Jun's Ruby OpenGL package easy to install, describe it, use it

  -- implement a type of "tdyn" for interface with Hans-Peter Bischof

* worldx.rb

  -- clean up the Integrator_pec_mode, predictor, etc (Jun's mail, 02 Feb '05)

  -- era: interface, not class; garbage collection of worldline's worldpoints

  -- I/O should output integrator info: clop to echo default values

  -- control structures for dt_dia and dt_out

  -- design timestep caculator based on predictor-corrector difference

  -- more R-K; general order Hermite; collocation; Richardson extrapolation

* new volumes

  -- how about the start of the new volume 0b ?

  -- how to present the Runge-Kutta survey in volume 1c?
