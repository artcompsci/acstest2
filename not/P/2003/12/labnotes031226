1. Book Volumes

We decided to write a new book volume for ACS 0.1, in which we will
describe what we have learned and are going to add since finishing our
previous book.  This new book can be read independently of the previous
book, although it logically follows the previous one.

2. Various Types Of Text

Our ACS 0.1 system, and presumably further versions as well, will
contain three places where we right text, all of it in rdoc form:

2.1. Narrative

These will form the book chapters, written in dialogue form.
We will create new fictional characters, with two astronomers as the
main characters for now.

2.2. Code

At the end of each piece of code, we will include a manual page, with
examples and background information.  This page will be formatted as
a single long string, assigned to a ruby variable, so we can print it
out, pass it around, etc.

2.3. Lab Notes

We provide a mechanism to add the lab notes of all sessions for a
given month into a single file.

3. Lab Notes

We wrote various scripts to combine lab notes in historical order,
creating for each particular file "labnote-filename" another file
".labnote-filename" that contains a time stamp.  These time stamps are
generated automatically.  If we are late in posting our lab notes, we
can change these times back by hand to the time to which the lab notes
apply.
