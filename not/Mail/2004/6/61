Hmm, well, not at this point...

Fourth  (or variation of the first) option is to put the provided code
to the ACS site "as is", *without* any quality control, as sourceforge
or raa-ruby-lang (Ruby application archive) does. This means we
effetively set up a ACS applicaion archive, "AAA" for short. We could
certainly ask Peter to set up something automatic, so that the writer
can update their contribution without our help.

Walter is very nice and important person, not somebody random. So for
his code, I think we should treat it with some care, and it may be
good to put his code "as is" under msa.
