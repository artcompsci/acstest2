I think a new volume is better. How should we name it? (Number or some
name like code_management?)

Also, could you remind me what else I'm supposed to do:

 --- cross-volume links
 --- history mechanism

What else? Amoung the above three, I guess the priority is:

1. code management
2. cross-volume links
3. history

Do you agree? I'll try to find time over weekend...
