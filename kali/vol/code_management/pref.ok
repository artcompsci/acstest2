= Preface

In this volume, Alice and Bob will search for ways to organize their
ever growing body of codes.  They hit upon a library structure, and a
way to let codes of different ages include different versions of
library files with the same name.

We hope to write this volume some time during 2005.

We thank xxx, xxx, and xxx for their comments on the
manuscript.
