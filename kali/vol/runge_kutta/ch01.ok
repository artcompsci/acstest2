= A First-Order Differential Equation

== Starting at Square One

*Bob*: It has been a lot of fun, to derive so many different algorithms
and to implement them all in our two-body code.

*Alice*: Yes, I enjoyed it too, and I must admit, I learned a lot in the
process.  But I still have the feeling that I'm missing some basic pieces
of insight.  Do you remember how we struggled, trying to prove that the
Abramowicz and Stegun formula was correct, the fourth-order
<tex>Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om</tex> scheme that had a misprint in it?

*Bob*: But you figured it out, didn't you?

*Alice*: Well, yes, after a false start.  And it was a bit alarming that
at first I didn't even realize that it was a false start.  And to be
completely honest, even now I'm not a full hundred percent sure that
we got things right.  Let me put it this way, I feel that I haven't
yet gotten a finger-tip feeling for what Runge-Kutta schemes are, and
how they really tick.

*Bob*: There must be several text books that you can look at.  Surely they
will explain things in more depth than you want to know.

*Alice*: I did look at some books on numerical methods, but none of them
gave me what I really wanted to see.  Some of them were just too
mathematical in their concern and notation, others didn't provide the
type of real detail that I wanted to see, yet others specialized on
particular approaches.  What I really would like to see is a pedestrian
approach, no attempt to design special improvements.  While I'm interested
in all the extras, from embedded higher-order schemes to using extrapolation
methods and symplectic schemes and what have you, I really would like to
first understand the basics better.

*Bob*: You mean, just the straightforward Runge-Kutta schemes of relatively
low order, without any extra bells and whistles?

*Alice*: Exactly.  Here is an idea.  If we limit ourselves to performing
at most two new force calculations per time step, things can't possibly
get too complex.  Our Abramowicz and Stegun formula already had three
force calculations per time step, and I'm not suggesting that we explore
explicitly the whole landscape around that formula, at least not yet.

*Bob*: So you want to explore a smaller landscape, just to see in front of
your eyes how everything works.  And while the simplest schemes, like
forward Euler and leapfrog, use only one new force calculation per
time step, you want to explore the full landscape of two new force
calculations per time step.  Hmm, I like that.  And I'm sure it would
be good for our students too, to see such an explicit survey.

*Alice*: I think so, but really, right now my main motivation is just for
myself to see exactly how those classical Runge-Kutta derivations are done,
from scratch, without taking anything on faith.

*Bob*: I like the idea, and I'm game.  Where shall we start?

== Keeping it Simple

*Alice*: One problem for astronomers using books on numerical solutions
to differential equations is that most books focus on first-order
differential equations.  In contrast, we typically work with
second-order differential equations, and often ones with special
properties.  The gravitational equations of motion for the N-body
problem, for example, have a force term that is independent of time
and velocity.

This suggests to me that we should divide our work into two stages.
First we try to figure out how to solve a general first-order
differential equation, using up to two force calculations per step.
This will reproduce the results from the standard text books, no
doubt, but it will give us experience and will allow us to establish
a notation and a systematic procedure.

Then, in the second stage, we can cut our teeth on the gravitational
N-body system, to see what special methods will work there, and why,
and how.  The Abramowicz and Stegun formula, for example, is tailored
already to second-order differential equations, albeit a general one
in which there is still a possible velocity dependence present in the
force calculations.  We can go one step further, specializing to
position dependence only, and just see what spectrum of methods we
will find.

Then, with a bit of luck, we will have gained enough experience to be
able to look over the horizon, to get an idea what you could do with,
say, three new force calculations per step, which is the landscape
within which the Abramowicz and Stegun formula was grown.

*Bob*: A somewhat ambitious project, but still quite doable, I think.
You basically want to take the next step beyond forward Euler and
leapfrog, in any possible direction, and see the dimensionality of the
space of possible directions.

*Alice*: Something like that, yes.  But let us restrict ourselves,
at least at first, to Runge-Kutta methods.  This will mean no multi-step
methods, such as the original Aarseth scheme.  It also means that we
won't use higher derivatives, such as the Hermite scheme.  In addition,
we will exclude the use of implicit methods, which require iteration.

*Bob*: You could argue that, with two new force calculations per time step,
you should allow implicit schemes that have just one new force calcuation
per time step.

*Alice*: You could, even though it is not immediately clear that one iteration
will provide you sufficiently rapid convergence.  Also, the resulting class of
implicit schemes is rather restricted.  Perhaps we can look at that later.
For now, I really want to be austere and stay to the absolute basics.

*Bob*: Okay: explicit Runge-Kutta methods using up to two new force
calculations per time step, and no evaluations of jerks or anything else.

== Notation

*Alice*: Let us start by choosing a specific notation.
For the simplest form of differential equation, we can write:

:equation:
{dx \over dt} = f(x)

where we will call the variable <tex>$x$</tex> the position and the
variable <tex>$t$</tex> the time.  The solution of this equation is
given by <tex>$x(t)$</tex>.  When we solve this equation numerically,
we use a finite time step <tex>$\tau$</tex>.  For now, we will analyze
the properties of the first time step.  We choose <tex>$t=0$</tex> at
the beginning of the first time step, and we denote the positions at
the beginning and end of the first time step by <tex>$x_0$</tex> and
<tex>$x_1$</tex>, respectively:

:equation:
x_0 \equiv x(0) \ \ \ \ \ ; \ \ \ \ x_1 \equiv x(\tau)

We can introduce the usual notation where a dot over a variable
indicates the time derivative and a prime indicates the space derivative:

:equation:
\dot x \equiv {dx \over dt} \equiv {d \over dt}x(t)

:equation:
f' \equiv {df \over dx} \equiv {d \over dx}f(x)

If we now want to determine the time derivative of the force,
we can use the chain rule, differentiating the force first with
respect to its argument _x_, and multiplying the result
with the time derivative of _x_:

:equation:
\dot f \equiv {d \over dt}f(x(t)) = {dx \over dt} f' = \dot x f'

For the various derivatives of the position, we can introduce the
historical notation in terms of velocity, acceleration, jerk,
snap, crackle and pop, respectively:

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
v \equiv \dot x = {d \over dt}x(t)     &;&
a \equiv \dot v = {d^2 \over dt^2}x(t)   \quad ; \quad
j \equiv \dot a = {d^3 \over dt^3}x(t)   \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
s \equiv \dot j = {d^4 \over dt^4}x(t)   &;&
c \equiv \dot s = {d^5 \over dt^5}x(t)   \quad ; \quad
p \equiv \dot c = {d^6 \over dt^6}x(t)
\end{array} \right.

These expressions are especially useful for the type of second-order
differential equation encountered in classical mechanics:

:equation:
\ddot x \equiv {d^2x \over dt^2} = f(x)

which can be written as a system of two first-order differential equations:

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
\dot x &=& v \\
\dot v &=& f(x)
\end{array} \right.

However, for now we will stick to the first-order differential
equation, using the general expression that we started with, but
without any explicit time dependence.

== Taylor Series

*Bob*: Even though this is just a warming-up exercise, it would be nice to
give a physical interpretation to the first-order differential equation
that you wrote down:

:equation:
{dx \over dt} = f(x)

I think it can be interpreted as describing the motion of an object
that is being pushed through a very resistive medium, such as a spoon
being pushed through molasses.  The velocity of the spoon is
proportional to the force term <tex>$f(x)$</tex> on the right-hand
side.

*Alice*: That would be a good example.

*Bob*: Okay, let's get to work.  You have struggled with these things
a lot more than I have.  How do we get started?

*Alice*: We want to check the quality of any given numerical approximation
scheme to the solution of our differential equation.  In order to do
so, we can compare such a scheme with a Taylor series developoment of
the true solution, around the starting point of our one integration
step.

In other words, we can express the position at the end of one time step
in the following Taylor series:

:equation:
x_1 = x_0 + v_0\tau + \half a_0\tau^2 + \one{6} j_0\tau^3 + \one{24} s_0\tau^4
+ O(\tau^5)

The velocity at time zero is given directly by the differential equation.
The higher derivatives of the position, starting with the acceleration,
can be found by differentiating both sides of the differential equation,
one or more times.  This leads to expressions such as:

:eqnarray:
v_0 &=& f(x(0)) \ = \ f(x_0) \ = \ f_0      \label{v0}  \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}                    \nonumber\\
a_0 &=& \dot v_0 \ = \ {d \over dt} f_0
\ = \ {df_0 \over dx} {dx \over dt}
\ = \ f_0' v_0 \ = \ f_0 f_0'               \label{a0} \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}                  \nonumber \\
j_0 &=& \dot a_0 \ = \ f_0^2 f_0'' + f_0 (f_0')^2     \label{j0} \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}                  \nonumber \\
s_0 &=& \dot j_0 \ = \ f_0^3 f_0''' + 4f_0^2f_0'f_0'' +
(f_0')^3 f_0           \label{s0}

*Bob*: Note that we should not interpret the acceleration as something that
happens as the result of a force being applied.  If a spoon moving
through molasses accelerates, it is the result of an <i>increase</i>
in the force.

*Alice*: That may take a bit of getting used to, but of course, for a
first-order differential equation, that makes sense.  Yes, it's nice to
have this picture of movement through a viscous medium as a guide.

== New Force Evaluations

*Bob*: I like the systematic approach idea, of using up to two
new force evaluations per time step.  Well, this gives us two
choices: either one or two force evaluations.

*Alice*: Actually, there are four choices.  In each case, we can try
to recycle a previous force calculation in the next step, or we don't.

*Bob*: You mean that you use the last force calculation, at the end of
a given step, as the first force value that you use for the next step?

*Alice*: Exactly.  And this will put rather strict conditions on the
nature of that force calculation.

*Bob*: It means, of course, that a force calculation needs to take place
at the boundary of two steps, otherwise you can't recycle it.  But that
doesn't seem to be a particularly severe restriction to me.

*Alice*: Oh, but there is more.  In a general Runge-Kutta approach, you
compute a few forces here and there, and only after doing that, you
combine those forces in such a way as to get a combination of them,
to give you a value of the new position accurate to high order.

Now the force that you would evaluate at that new position, at the
beginning of the next time step, will in general not be the same as
the force that you have calculated at the end of the current time step.
Even though it was evaluated at the same time, it will in general be
evaluated at a slightly different place.  The reason is that at the 
time of evaluation, you didn't yet have in hand the most accurate
estimate for the new position.

*Bob*: Hmm, that's tricky.  I hadn't thought about that.

*Alice*: I hadn't either, until I started playing with some of those
schemes in detail.  All the more reason to take a really pedestrian
approach, and just write everything out, to make sure we're not
overlooking something or jumping to conclusions!

To start with, let us _not_ try to recycle any forces.  Within that
category of attempts, we will first investigate what can happen when
we allow just one force evaluation per step, and then we will move
on to two force evaluations per step.  After that, we'll look at
recycling.

*Bob*: Fair enough!

== One Force Evaluation per Step

*Alice*: At the start of a time step, the only evaluation of the right-hand
side of the differential equation that is possible is the one at
<tex>$t=0$</tex>:

:equation:
k_1 = f(x_0)

This leads to the following dimensionally correct expression:

:equation:
x_1 = x_0 + \alpha_1 k_1\tau

Combining the last two equations, we have

:equation:
x_1 = x_0 + \alpha_1 f_0\tau \label{rk1}

We can compare this expression with our Taylor series:

:equation:
x_1 = x_0 + v_0\tau + \half a_0\tau^2 + O(\tau^3)

Using Eqs. (\ref{v0}) and (\ref{a0}),
we can write this as

:equation:
x_1 = x_0 + f_0\tau + \half f_0 f_0'\tau^2 + O(\tau^3) \label{taylor1}

How accurate is our new value <tex>$x_1$</tex> after we take one step?  Let us
see how well we can match Eq. (\ref{rk1}) with Eq. (\ref{taylor1}),
in successive powers of <tex>$\tau$</tex>.  The constant term <tex>$x_0$</tex> matches
trivially, and our first condition arises from the term linear in <tex>$\tau$</tex>:

:equation:
\alpha_1 f_0 = f_0

hence

:equation:
\fbox{
$\displaystyle{
\alpha_1 = 1
}$
}

We have no free parameter left, so this leads us to the
only possible explicit first-order integration scheme

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
x_1 &=& x_0 + k_1\tau  \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
k_1 &=& f(x_0)
\end{array} \right.                    \label{forward}

which is the forward-Euler algorithm.  This scheme is only first-order
accurate, since it cannot possibly reproduce the <tex>$O(\tau^2)$</tex> term in
Eq. (\ref{taylor1}):
such a match would require <tex>$\half f_0 f_0' = 0$</tex>,
which is certainly not true for general force prescriptions.

*Bob*: Of course, forward Euler is the simplest possible scheme.  It is
what anyone would have guessed, if they had guessed any scheme at all

*Alice*: That may be true, but I, for one, like to see a _derivation_ for
any integration scheme, even the simplest and humblest of them all.  It is 
all nice and fine to say that something is intuitively obvious, but I am
much happier if you can _prove_ that something is not only simple, but
actually the simplest, and under certain plausible restrictions, the _only_
one of its kind.

*Bob*: Can't argue about taste.  I can see your point, but any good point
can be pressed to extremes.  Well, as long as you do the calculating, I'll
sit back and relax.

== Two Force Evaluations per Step

*Alice*: Now we can move to more interesting venues, when we allow
two force evaluations per step.  After a first evaluation of the
right-hand side of the differential equation, we can perform a
preliminary integration in time, after which we can evaluate the
right-hand side again, at a new position:

:eqnarray:
k_1 &=& f(x_0)    \\
k_2 &=& f(x_0 + \eta k_1 \tau)

We can now use a more general expression for the new position:

:equation:
x_1 = x_0 + \left( \alpha_1 k_1 + \alpha_2 k_2 \right) \tau  \label{alg11}

Combining these equations, we have

:equation:
x_1 = x_0 + \left\{ 
\alpha_1 f_0 + \alpha_2 f(x_0 +\eta f_0 \tau) \right\} \tau \label{alg12}

The right-most term in Eqs. (\ref{alg11}) and (\ref{alg12}) can be
expanded in a power series in <tex>$\tau$</tex> when we develop <tex>$k_2$</tex> in a Taylor
series around <tex>$\tau = 0$</tex>:

:equation:
k_2 = f(x_0 +\eta f_0 \tau) =
f_0 + (\eta f_0) f_0' \tau + \half (\eta f_0)^2 f_0'' \tau^2
+ O(\tau^3)  \label{alg13}

We thus find for the new position, at the end of our time step:

:equation:
x_1 = x_0 + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) f_0 \tau +
\alpha_2 \eta f_0 f_0' \tau^2 +
\half \alpha_2 \eta^2 f_0^2 f_0'' \tau^3 + O(\tau^4) \label{rk2}

We can now compare this expression with the Taylor series expansion of
the true orbit:

:equation:
x_1 = x_0 + v_0\tau + \half a_0\tau^2
+ \one{6} j_0\tau^3  + O(\tau^4)                \label{taylor0}

Using Eqs. (\ref{v0}), (\ref{a0}), and (\ref{j0}), 
we can write this as

:equation:
x_1 = x_0 + f_0\tau + \half f_0 f_0'\tau^2
+ \one{6} \left\{ f_0^2 f_0'' + f_0 (f_0')^2 \right\} \tau^3
+ O(\tau^4) \label{taylor2}

To what order can we make Eqs. (\ref{rk2}) and (\ref{taylor2}) compatible?
Starting with terms to first order in <tex>$\tau$</tex>, we have to insist that

:equation:
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) f_0 = f_0

which leads to the condition

:equation:
\fbox{
$\displaystyle{
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = 1
}$
}

To second order in <tex>$\tau$</tex>, we would like to satisfy:

:equation:
\alpha_2 \eta f_0 f_0' = \half f_0 f_0'

which can be done through the condition

:equation:
\fbox{
$\displaystyle{
\eta = {1 \over 2 \alpha_2}
}$
}

Would it be possible to match Eqs. (\ref{rk2}) and (\ref{taylor2}) also to
third order in <tex>$\tau$</tex>?  This would require

:equation:
\half \alpha_2 \eta^2 f_0^2 f_0'' =
\one{6} \left\{f_0^2 f_0'' + f_0 (f_0')^2 \right\}

While we can match the first term on the right-hand side, by choosing
<tex>$\alpha_2 \eta^2 = 1/3$</tex>, this would require that <tex>$f_0 (f_0')^2 = 0$</tex>,
which is not true for general force prescriptions.

== xxx

We have to conclude that our scheme is only second-order
accurate.  We have three free parameters, <tex>$\alpha_1$</tex>, <tex>$\alpha_2$</tex>, and
<tex>$\eta$</tex>.  Since we only have two conditions, Eqs. (xx) and (yy)
{\bf[note: box ref problem]}, we can expect to be left with one degree
of freedom in choosing the coefficients in our algorithm.  This is
indeed the case.  If we write <tex>$\alpha = \alpha_2$</tex>, we obtain:

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
\alpha_1 &=& 1 - \alpha  \\
\alpha_2 &=& \alpha \\
\eta &=& 1 / (2\alpha)
\end{array} \right.

we obtain the following family
of algorithms:

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
x_1 &=& x_0 + \left( (1-\alpha)k_1 + \alpha k_2 \right) \tau \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
k_1 &=& f(x_0)  \\
k_2 &=& f(x_0 + {1\over 2 \alpha} k_1 \tau)
\end{array} \right.                         \label{rk2alpha}

One classical choice for a second-order Runge-Kutta is <tex>$\alpha = \half$</tex>,
leading to:

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
x_1 &=& x_0 + \half \left( k_1 + k_2 \right) \tau \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
k_1 &=& f(x_0)  \\
k_2 &=& f(x_0 + k_1 \tau)
\end{array} \right.                     \label{rk2alphahalf}

Another classical choice is <tex>$\alpha = 1$</tex>, which gives:

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
x_1 &=& x_0 + k_2 \tau \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
k_1 &=& f(x_0)  \\
k_2 &=& f(x_0 + \half k_1 \tau)
\end{array} \right.

For <tex>$\alpha = \half$</tex>, we effectively average the evaluations at the
beginning and at the end of the trial step, while for <tex>$\alpha = 1$</tex>, we
use only the evaluation at the end of a smaller trial step that brings
us approximately mid-way between the beginning and the end of the step.
