May well be.  However, I was thinking to stick to:

-- in 13: the observation that binaries form, experimentally;
-- in 14: replacing tight binaries by unperturbed Kepler orbits,
          as a simple but perhaps necessary trick to do a core
          collapse and beyond for a few-hundred body system
-- in 15: to simply show that you can get beyond core collapse.

I think it would be nice to aim at this overall physical picture,
and then, from 16 onward, go into more detail; probably first a
toy stellar evolution model.

Anyway, that's all a bit aways, late 2005 at the earliest.
For now, we can just keep these titles as place holders,
unless you prefer otherwise.

Meanwhile, I've spent hours going through a few lines of
Binney & Tremaine.  I had forgotten how dense some of the
text is.  I produce at least one page of explanation for
a typical line that I borrow from their book . . . just
now working out Abel transformations . . . yareyare, I've
gotten rusty in working with integrals . . . but it will
be great to have all this written down, for my own future
reference as well!
