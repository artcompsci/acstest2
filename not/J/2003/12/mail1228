 Hmm, personally, I prefer something else than "dia", since not
 completely everything under that will be dialogues. How about bks
 (books), vls (volumes), trs (tours), or ...

 Well, I guess this script itself should go somewhere under
 src/coherent_programming, with comments etc...
 
 where to place "binaries" would be a different question. If we follow
 usual ruby convention, we should prepare install.rb to each directory
 with source files for command script, and install.rb would basically
 put things to /usr/local/bin or somewhere specified in some way.
 
 To have $ACSROOT/bin is okay, but I *think* it should not be part of
 svn. Everything under bin should be generated from "sources" under src
 directory, either by make or by src/install.rb.
 
 I'd prefer to have $ACSBIN, which you can set to whatever you like.

 Well, for something like Todo file, I guess sort of logical place
 would be
 
 --- top level ACSROOT itself
 --- ACSROOT/src
 --- ACSROOT/not
 
 To have it at combined is a bit strange, I think. For rdoc, you can
 pass relative path for To do file. So I do not it is necessary to put
 it in combined...

 Hmmm, well, but isn't it better to allow something like:
 
 <memo Peter>  nemo snapshot is better </memo>
 
 Personally, I *feel* these are better done with emacs macros, since it
 is probably better to be able to see "[Jun ... -- Jun]" in the source
 text file itself, instead of <j> .... </j>.
 
 How do you think?

 I put my notes on ch1.cp and ch2.cp. So please look at them.

 In the source level, what we could do is
 
 -- to define the body class (except for the method to calculate
    gravity) as include file, and use them from the main source
 
 -- or, equivalently (but in the opposite way), to have force
    calculation method as separate include file.

 Sorry, I do not quite understand what happened to your files... I
 tried
 
 ruby src/coherent_programming/acsdoc.rb not/combined/* dia/*cp dia/*rb
 
 which worked fine. (I made the following change to acsdoc.rb, so that
 it can handle files not in current dir)
 
  diff -C0 acsdoc.rb*
 *** acsdoc.rb   2003-12-28 20:55:58.000000000 +0900

 By the way, currently there are couple of things missing in rdoc. One
 is the way to include a segment of (for example) a ruby file in the
 text, and the second is (as far as I can see) the way to put the name
 tag in the generated HTML file. If you write <a name=xxx>, <> are
 converted to &lt;&gt;, resulting in texts.
 
 For the first one, I guess something like
 
  :segment start: segment_name
  ...
  ...
  :segment end:
 
 which would generate the file named .xxx.rb-segment_name would be
 fine. Then you can just include it. Do you have
 suggestion/comments/whatever?  (See my notes in Dec 26)
 
 Well, the above "(See my notes in Dec 26)" is a good example for the
 need to refer to part of the log file. I think it is relatively easy
 to have something like <name>tag_name</name> or just -tag_name- to be
 recognized by rdoc. The problem is that then our rdoc becomes
 inconpatible, and someday someone else may introduce something
 similar, but not the same. How do you think?
