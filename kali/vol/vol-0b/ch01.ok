<b>Note:</b>

Mention here also PROMINENTLY things like <i>Libraries, Code Index,

It is especially important to point out how and where to find the
codes that are being mentioned in the volumes.

== Test of TeX Math macros

Try <$a^2 = b^2 + c^2$> first and then 

and <$$a^2 = b^2 + c^2$$> and also

<$$
a^2 = b^ + c^2
$$>

to see what happens.

Ah: the first two work, but the last one doesn't.
