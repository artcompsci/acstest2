= Local installation instruction

 P. Hut and J. Makino 2005-

Just run

  ruby install.rb

as supersuser. Note that this will replace your installed rdoc (if you
have any). This may result in some problem, since some of new rdoc
document for some Ruby sources might work only with later versions of
Rdoc.  We plan to become independent of rdoc in some future.
