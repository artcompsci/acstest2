<h3>ACS 1.2.2</h3>

ACS 1.2.2 was released on January 12, 2006.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="acs-1.2.2.tgz">acs-1.2.2.tgz</a> (roughly 200 Mbyte)
<br>
<li>
<a href="acs-lite-1.2.2.tgz">acs-lite-1.2.2.tgz</a> (roughly 15 Mbyte)
<li>
ACS 1.2.2 presents a new lay-out of the ACS home page,
which reflects our latest thoughts about the structure
and evolution of our ongoing projects of development of
simulation code and documentation.
<li>
The <a href="../kali/index.html">Maya Project</a> is the new name for
what we used to call the Kali project.  <i>Maya</i> is now the name
for the software environment within which we will run the <i>Kali code</i>,
which will be our flagship integrator for simulating dense stellar systems.
While <i>Maya</i> will denote our virtual laboratory, <i>Kali</i> will
be our main laboratory tool.
<li>
We have started to rewrite our very first volume,
<a href="../msa/web/vol_1/v1_web/v1_web.html">Moving Stars Around</a>,
to bring it in line with the Maya project.  Specifically, we will use
a much more flexible plotting package, we will introduce a visualization
tool, and all codes will be written in Ruby.
<li>
We have a <a href="../kali/revised-five-year-plan.html">revised
five-year plan</a> for the Kali code development.
<li>
In addition, again a large number of small corrections have been made.
<li>
For instructions to install the computer codes on your own computer, see this
<a href=README.html>README page</a>.
</ul>

<h3>ACS 1.2.1</h3>

<a href="acs-lite-1.2.1.tgz">acs-lite-1.2.1.tgz</a> (roughly 15 Mbyte)
<li>
ACS 1.2.1 presents the first part of what will be a new volume,
<a href="../kali/vol/multiple_runs/doc/files/_/_title_ok.html">16. 
N-Body Experiments: Orchestrating and Analyzing Multiple Runs</a>
<li>
We have drawn up our <a href="../kali/first-five-year-plan.html">first
five-year plan</a> for the Kali code development.
<li>
In addition, a large number of small corrections have been made.

<h3>ACS 1.2</h3>

ACS 1.2 was released on April 13, 2005.

<ul>
<li>

<br>
<li>
<a href="acs-lite-1.2.tgz">acs-lite-1.2.tgz</a> (roughly 15 Mbyte)
<li>
A novel feature of ACS 1.2 is the presentation of an N-body code that
allows individual particles to use not only individual time steps, but
also individual integration algorithms, from a wide range of choices
including <a href="acs-2.1-README.html">... (more)</a>

<h3>ACS 1.0</h3>

Our first ACS version, ACS 1.0, was released on June 2, 2004.
<p>
It contains the versions, at that time, of the first four volumes of
the Kali project, together with the first volume of the Open Knowledge
umbrella project.  In addition, the older volume <i>Moving Stars
Around</i>, is included.  In total, this release contains the
equivalent of roughly 700 pages of printed text,
together with the computer codes developed in the text.
<p>
We are making all releases presented here available under the
conditions of our <a href="mit.html">ACS open source license</a>.
<p>
We present ACS 1.0 in two option, each as a single tar file:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="acs-1.0.tgz">acs-1.0.tgz</a> (roughly 100 Mbyte), containing
<ul>
<li>
all html files present on the ACS web site at the time this version
was released
</li>
<li>
postscript and pdf versions of the text files
</li>
<li>
all computer codes discussed in the text
</li>
<li>
additional codes that are used for generating the .html, .ps, and .pdf
files from the original .ok files
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
<a href="acs-lite-1.0.tgz">acs-lite-1.0.tgz</a> (roughly 15 Mbyte), containing
<ul>
<li>
a few top-level html files
</li>
<li>
all computer codes discussed in the text
</li>
<li>
the .ok files and codes that allow automatic construction of the .html,
.ps, and .pdf files, with the exception of those connected with the
MSA volume.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Note that you need to have a Ruby interpreter, in order to run the
computer codes that are provided.  If you don't have Ruby already
installed on your computer, you can pick up the latest version from
the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby Home Page</a>.
