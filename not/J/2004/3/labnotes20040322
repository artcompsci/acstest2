== Thoughts on implementing TeX maths into cp system

=== Command syntax

Possible examples are:

":tex: $x=a$ :tex:"

This is rather long. Extreme possibility is to have direct thing like
$x=x$ embedded in the text, which then requires some escaping back
sequence.

I made changes to acsdoc.rb so that the base function to process .cp
file now takes an array of string as input and returns (currently
somewhat inconvenient) large single string with newlines enbedded.
