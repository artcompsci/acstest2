Jun,

By the way:

The old "vol-13/kali1.rb" code, which I renamed "vol-7b/world4.rb"
code now has the following modifications:

1) I absorbed your nice Runge-Kutta scheme, and svn del the two
   parallel versions we had

2) I changed the INIT_TIMESCALE_FACTOR constant that we introduced
   for the multistep startup from a CONSTANT to a command line option:
   -f allows you to change it, and the default is 0.01 .
   The reason I did this, is that I had two versions of the code,
   one with 10^-6 and one with 10^-2, and I was very puzzled why
   I got slightly different results after a few time step . . . .

3) I added a dump option -z that outputs all world points

Piet
