The <i>Kali</i> project is directed toward the construction of a
laboratory for dense stellar systems, such as star clusters, star
forming regions, and galactic nuclei containing one or more massive
black holes.  The presentation is centered around dialogues between two
astrophysicists, Alice and Bob, who are in the process of constructing the
Kali code from scratch.
