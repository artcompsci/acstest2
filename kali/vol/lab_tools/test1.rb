  Description: Find the first reported binary, print its story and exit
  Long description:
    This program accepts a stream of Nbody snapshots, and checks the story of
    each one until it finds the first reported binary.  It then prints that
    story on the standard output, and exits.

    example:

        kali mkplummer.rb -n 8 | kali world4.rb -t 1000 -x 0.1 | kali #{$0}

      exit
    end
