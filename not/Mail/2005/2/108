Well, actually, I do not think we'll have any better idea in
future. We basically need to define the library structure which can
survive the changes we make in future.

So I think we need to clarify *what we want to do*.

I guess the things we want are

 a) using command script defined in some other volume
 b) using library defined in some other volume

Anything else?

If a and b are the only things we want, we can simply define the
directories for command script and libraries, and have "make install"
to copy them from the source (vol) directory to there.

We probably want to have some check script which test if more than one
vol directories are exporting the same file or not.
