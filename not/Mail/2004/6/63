Hi Jun:

I hope you had a good flight, and you're having a good meeting
in Amsterdam.  Over the weekend, I have started to make good
progress on vol. 11: Plummer's Model.  It will become a whole
volume, since I will explain about background of model making,
use of standard units, provide test codes for energy checking
and radial quartiles checking, and so on.

Also, I realized that it is *exceedingly* simple to add the
Hermite algorithm to the codes in volumes 2 and 3, so I did
that as well.  That is a much more natural place for them,
instead of waiting for a later volume.  And I have enough
room in volume 2 to explain the basic ideas (I can take that
from MSA).

This means that we have to change the title of volume 9.
I propose to make it "Variable Time Steps".  The volume
titles now look very natural, in their succession, so I
added the next four volume titles and directories:

   0. A Vision
   1. The Two-Body Problem
   2. Integration Algorithms
   3. The N-Body Problem
   4. User Interface  
   5. Open Knowledge  
   6. Speeding up Ruby  
   7. Self-Describing Data Files
   8. Graphics  
   9. Variable Time Steps  
   10. Individual Time Steps  
   11. Plummer's Model  
   12. Core Collapse
   13. Binary Formation
   14. Kepler Regularization
   15. Beyond Core Collapse

This will allow me to start writing text for some of the
future volumes, when I have time, just like I am doing now
for Plummer's model.

Let me know whether you like these titles, or have another
preference.

Piet
