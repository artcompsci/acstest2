== Thoughts on svn system on WWW

Basic idea: www.artcompsci.org shows the complete acs source+whatever
directory tree.

Practical stuff.

* I (JM) do not want to make svn tree publicly readable.
  * Need to study subversion documents
  * Need to switch to Apache 2 from 1.3
  * Potential security problems

* Question on where to put tarballs and how
  * In principle (and probably in practice also), a tarball can be
    generated from some earlier svn release.
  * In that sense, it is not really critical to have a safe and
    foolproof way to regenerate old versions
  * On the other hand, svn release number itself need to be memorized

Algorithm to generate tarball  

  1) determine the version number. Echo previous version (if any) and
     request keyin
  2) create the list of files by svn list -R at the top level
  3) Make sure the files, in particular the books ps, pdf, and html
     files,  which are not under SVN version control are
     actually the latest, by saying make book at the vol top level
     directory.
  4) The script to create tarball need to know about these files.
     I *think* it's okay to just put the name (or directory) of the
     files in something like bin/export.rb     

Maybe better to keep HTML files etc in separate location?

Yet another thought: Should we move everything currently under acs to
asc/kali? Maybe not for now, but...
