README for ACS Version 1.1

Piet Hut and Jun Makino

While all the material presented here is freely available on our
web site "http://www.ArtCompSci.org", you may want to download a
copy on your own computer.  The easiest way to do so is to pick
up the latest ACS release version, from "http://www.ArtCompSci.org/rel/"
in the form of a single gzipped tar file, often refered to as a "tar ball".

This tar ball contains the following files:

Document volumes:

acs-1.1.tgz comes with a complete set of HTML/PS/PDF documents for the
ACS project, containing the source text for all volumes released so far.
To look at the documents, start at the "index.html" file at the top level
directory, the same directory in which you have found this README file.
Within this "index.html" file, you will find pointers to all volumes
available in the current version, separately in HTML, in PS, and in PDF
formats.

Source codes:

In the current release, the source files for the text volumes and the
source files for the computer programs can all be found in the
"PROJECT/vol/vol-X" directories.

For example, to find the text for volume 1b in the Kali series,
go to "kali/vol/vol-1b", where you will find, say, chapter 3 as
"kali/vol/vol-1b/ch03.ok".  The extension "ok" stands for open
knowledge, and the files are written in a variant on the rdoc system;
we will explain more about this system in volume 10, which we plan to
write in 2005.

You can find the computer codes that are used in a particular volume
in the same directory where the text is stored.  For example, in
chapter 3 of volume 1b, you will find that a program "rkbody.rb" is
invoked.  The source for this program is: "kali/vol/vol-1b/rkbody.rb".

How to run a computer program, used in the text:

Currently, all programs that are mentioned in a given volume are designed
to be run within the directory where they resides. For example, if you
want to run the program "integrator_driver4epc.rb" that is mentioned
in volume 1-b of the Kali series, you first have to descend from the
current top level, where this README file resides, to the directory
of volume 1b, and then you have to give the command "ruby" to run the
program, as follows:

    cd kali/vol/vol-1b; ruby integrator_driver4epc.rb < euler.in

which should create the same output as what appears in chapter 9 of
volume 1b, where the same line is given, with the input file "euler.in"
also present in that directory.

In order to run Ruby programs, you need to have Ruby installed on your
machine, visit the "http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" web site.

Enjoy!
