Yes, please!  And in our volumes, we can describe this either
in volume 3b (user interface) or in volume 4 (ACS data format).
That way, I can then start writing volumes 3b,4,5,etc, using this
new convention.  We could also write a new volume about it.

What do you think is best: put it in volume 3b (user interface) or
in volume 4 (ACS data format), or in a new volume (libraries and
code management)?

Piet

P.S.: yes, I realize that some individual volumes will have individual
      versions of some files; well, that cannot be helped . . . .
