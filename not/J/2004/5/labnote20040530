== More on tarball for the versioned ACS site

The tarball should contain

* ALL files archived in svn
* ALL files under doc directories
* Some of specified files, such as vol/vol-1/volume1.ps (if exists)
  etc.

Anything else?

== acsdoc more changes:

Now it accepts two extentions (.cp and .ok) as the file name for the
text files.

== Make memo

Currently, Make requires environment variable DVIPDF to has the value
of a command to create PDF file, if PDF files are to be generated. If
DVIPDF is not set, make does not create PDF files.
