<h3>
Goal: Modeling Dense Stellar Systems
</h3>

In the center of our galaxy resides a supermassive black hole,
surrounded by a swarm of a few million stars, packed within a region
with a size of only a few light years.  In such a dense stellar system,
stars will frequently collide with each other, with intervals of at
most a few thousand years.  Given the age of the galactic nucleus,
around ten billion years,  more collisions must have happened than
there are stars currently present.
<p>
Other examples of dense stellar systems are the cores of centrally
concentrated globular clusters, such as M15 and M30, where a typical
star can also expect a collision on a time scale that is shorter than
the age of the globular cluster.  Some of the older open clusters, and
many star forming regions are also called dense stellar systems, since
there, too, stars can individually affect each other, through
collisions or close passages.
<p>
In contrast, most stars in a typical galaxy, including our Sun, lead
much less perturbed lives.  For the Sun, the chance to collide with
another star at any point during its life time is less than one in a
million.  This translates into a collision probability of only
10<sup>-16</sup> per year.  In our Milky Way galaxy as a whole, by far
most stars, whether single or binaries or multiple systems, can be
modeled in isolation.
<p>
Those stars that do reside in dangerously crowded areas lead far more
interesting lives than those that live in the galactic suburbs and
country side.  And when two or more stars in a dense stellar system
collide, their merger remnant looks and evolves quite different from
garden variety stars.  While normal stars start there life at the main
sequence, a merger remnant is born in a rather different part of the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.  Even after an initial phase in which
such a remnant settles into thermal equilibrium, the unusual mix of
chemical composition as a function of radius will make such a stars
markedly different in its evolution.
<p>
Observationally, some of these merger remnants will show up in the H-R
diagram as blue stragglers: they are bluer than the turn-off, giving the
semblance of being younger that the age of the other stars in their
environment.  And in a sense, they are younger, as counted from their
collisional formation, even though their progenitors (or in the case
of multiple collisions, their ancestors) can share the same age as the
majority of stars in the cluster.
<p>
Theoretically, there is great interest in studying the weird variety
of single stars and especially binary stars, that can be formed in
dense stellar systems.  Examples are Low-Mass X-ray Binaries and
Millisecond Pulsars in orbit around other stars.  Both types of
systems occur in globular clusters with a far larger abundance than in
the rest of the galaxy, an indication that most of them are formed
through collisions or at least close encounters.  In such encounters
members in a binary can be swapped in a three-body or four-body
encounter with other single stars or binaries.
<p>
In order to understand more about the most extreme states of matter,
such as neutron stars and black holes, we can follow the same approach
as particle physicists.  They study their elementary particles by
colliding them and by observing their bound states.  Similarly, by
observing neutron stars and possibly black holes in a globular
cluster, we can get a handle on how they underwent collisions and how
they are bound to other stars.
<p>
Especially in the case of black holes, there is no easy way to observe
such an object when it is just moving around the cluster by itself.
But if it is part of a close binary system, we can observe the hot gas
around the black hole.  Some of that gas will fall into the hole, and
some of it may escape, possibly in the form of jets.  In either case,
X-ray observations can tell us a lot about the processes happening
close to the black hole.  Similarly, close binaries containing neutron
stars provide great diagnostics for the structure and evolution of
these stars.
<p>
The main goal of the Maya project is to provide detailed models both
for the way stars interact locally through encounters and collisions,
and for the way a whole star cluster evolves under the influence of
such processes.
