<h3>
Goal: Modeling Dense Stellar Systems
</h3>

In the center of our galaxy resides a supermassive black hole,
surrounded by a swarm of a few million stars, packed within a region
with a size of only a few light years.  Similar stellar densities are
reached in the cores of dense globular clusters.  In both cases, a
significant fraction of the stars will undergo close encounters and
even collisions.
<p>
When two or more stars in such a dense stellar system collide, their
merger remnant looks and evolves quite different from garden variety
stars.  While normal stars start there life at the main sequence, a
merger remnant is born in a rather different part of the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.  Even after an initial phase in which
such a remnant settles into thermal equilibrium, the unusual mix of
chemical composition as a function of radius will make such a stars
markedly different in its evolution.
<p>
Observationally, some of these merger remnants will show up in the H-R
diagram as blue stragglers: they are bluer than the turn-off, giving the
semblance of being younger that the age of the other stars in their
environment.  And in a sense, they are younger, as counted from their
collisional formation, even though their progenitors (or in the case
of multiple collisions, their ancestors) can share the same age as the
majority of stars in the cluster.
<p>
There is great interest in studying the weird variety of single stars
and especially binary stars, that can be formed in dense stellar
systems.  Examples are Low-Mass X-ray Binaries and Millisecond Pulsars
in orbit around other stars.  Both types of systems occur in globular
clusters with a far larger abundance than in the rest of the galaxy,
an indication that most of them are formed through collisions or at
least close encounters.  In such encounters members in a binary can be
swapped in a three-body or four-body encounter with other single stars
or binaries.
<p>
The optical observations of blue stragglers, X-ray observations of
compact binaries, and radio observations of millisecond pulsars,
are just a few examples of the observational wealth of data that is
currently available.  The obvious way to interpret these data is to
model a dense stellar system in realistic detail, through large-scale
simulations, taking into account all the relevant physics involved.
<p>
The main goal of the Maya project is to provide detailed models both
for the way stars interact locally through encounters and collisions,
and for the way a whole star cluster evolves under the influence of
such processes.  In order to accomplish this, we will need to couple
a rather heterogeneous collection of software modules, each describing
different physical problems, such as stellar dynamics, stellar
evolution, and stellar hydrodynamics.  Let us look at each of these
three topics, in turn.

<h3>
Stellar Dynamics: The Gravitational Million-Body Problem
</h3>

When Newton developed classical mechanics, including the classical
theory of gravity, his main application was the N-body problem.  The
term <i>problem</i> is used in mathematics and therefore also in
mathematical physics to indicate a topic with a question that has not
(yet) been solved.  For example, the famous four-color problem, the
question of how many different colors we need to introduce to color a
map such that neighboring countries can always be given different
colors, remained a real problem until the nineteen seventies. Partly
with the help of computers, this problem was solved (the answer was:
four colors suffice), and then the four-color problem turned into the
four-color theorem.  Similarly, the same term `problem' was used to
describe the challenge to find the motions of two, three, or more
bodies under the influence of their mutual gravitational attractions:
hence the two-body problem, the three-body problem, etc.
<p>
Unlike the four-color problem, though, we don't expect to ever `solve'
the gravitational N-body problem, for arbitrary N ­ and even for N = 2,
where we do have analytic solutions, we still follow tradition in
calling this the two-body problem (strictly speaking, this probably
should be called the two-body system).  Why would someone want to
study the gravitational million-body problem? There are at least four
quite different motivations, centering on the fields of astronomy,
theoretical physics, computational physics, and mathematics.  We
summarize these four here briefly; for a lenghtier introduction, see
part I of
<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521774861">The
Gravitational Million-Body Problem</a> (Heggie &amp; Hut, 2003).
<p>
For astronomers, the study of dense stellar systems forms the most
challenging area of stellar physics.  Systems are called dense if the
stars are so closely packed in space that they will occasionally
suffer close encounters and even physical collisions.  Two examples
of dense stellar systems are globular clusters and galactic nuclei.
In our own Milky Way galaxy, at least, the typical number of stars in
a globular cluster lies between 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup>,
and the number of stars directly influenced by the massive central
black hole is between 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup>.  So even
though our galaxy as a whole contains a hundred billion stars, the
most interesting dense stellar systems in our galaxy can be described
by the gravitational million-body problem.
<p>
For theoretical physicists, the study of self-gravitating systems of
particles is challenging because such systems cannot be described by
standard thermodynamic methods.  The methods of plasma physics fail
because gravitational forces, being attractive, are unshielded.
Historically, many developments in mathematical physics, from
perturbation theory to the discovery of chaos, were triggered by
problems encountered in trying to acquire a deeper understanding of
the N-body problem.
<p>
For computational physicists, the N-body problem is one of the prime
examples of hard problems.  In fact, it is not even clear whether any
solution can be obtained reliably at all, given the exponential
divergence of orbital solutions.  And apart from such fundamental
issues, running an N-body simulation with N > 10,000 is exceptionally
time-consuming for even the fastest generally available computers. This
has led to the development of special computers (the 
<a href="http://www.astrogrape.org/">GRAPE</a> family), whose main
task is to solve this problem very quickly.  Developing the software
for running N-body simulations is equally challenging.  In globular
cluster simulations, we are confronted with length scales spanning
the range from kilometers to parsecs (a factor of more than
10<sup>13</sup>), and with time scales spanning the range from
milliseconds to the life time of the universe (a factor of more than
10<sup>20</sup>).
<p>
For mathematicians, there has been a steady flow of inspiration
stemming from the N-body problem. When Newton laid the foundations of
classical physics in the Principia, among the mathematical tools he
deployed was the infinitesimal calculus, which he had invented for the
purpose.  The famous theorem of Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser was
foreshadowed by the work of C.L. Siegel in his book on Celestial
Mechanics, a form of the gravitational N-body problem.

<h3>
History of Gravitational N-body Simulations
</h3>

Computer simulations of the gravitational N-body problem have a rich
history.  The Figure below shows how the value of N has grown, from 16
in the first publication by von Hoerner in 1960, till 128k, which is
the state of the art at the moment.
<p>
<img hspace=3 src="dates.gif" align=left>
Added to the figure are the predicted publication times for
calculations with a quarter million, a half million and a million
bodies, in 2010, 2015, and 2020, respectively, using future members of
the GRAPE family.  The slope of the lines connecting the dots can be
explained roughly by combining Moore's law, which tells us that
computer speed increases by a factor ten every five years, and the
fact that the cost of N-body simulations grows proportional to
N<sup>3</sup>, implying a doubling in the maximum N value
approximately every four years.
<p>
During the sixties, a type of Cambrian explosion of different
approaching to simulating the N-body problem took place.  However,
from 1970 onward, <a href="http://sverre.com/">Sverre Aarseth</a>'s
programs, from Nbody1 through Nbody6, have dominated the field.
For a detailed description of these programs, see his book
<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521432723">Gravitational
N-Body Simulations</a>.
<p>
It took a quarter century for a competitor to appear, the Kira code in
the <a href="http://www.ids.ias.edu/~starlab/">starlab</a>
environment, which has been used from around 1995 onward, to simulate
large N-body systems.  The current Maya project aims at developing the
Kali code, as a third alternative to the Nbody6 and Kira codes.  The
main difference between Kali and previous code will be the extremely
modular nature of Kali, made possible in part by the fact that Kali is
written in a modern scripting language, Ruby, whereas Nobody6 is
written in Fortran, and Kira is written in C++.

<h3>
Stellar Evolution
</h3>

During the first 35 years of N-body simulations, the bodies in
question were largely modeled as point particles without internal
structure.  By the mid nineteen nineties, simulation codes appeared
that gave each body more of a semblance of a real star, the
<a href="http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~jhurley/m67.html">BSE extension of
Nbody4</a> and the <a href="http://www.ids.ias.edu/~starlab/seba/">SeBa
extension of the Kira code</a>.

The Need for a New Approach
</h3>
Science is undergoing its second revolution.  From theory only for the
Greeks, to theory and experiment around 1600, to theory, experiment
and simulations now.  We don't know yet how to write large software
systems.
