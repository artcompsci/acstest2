= Preface

The current version of this volume only contains the sixth-order
Yoshida algorithm, and the Hermite algorithm, both for a general
N-body system, with shared fixed time steps.  We plan to make a
variety of other algorithms available here, following the two-body
prototypes given in volume 1b, by later 2004 or early 2005.

We thank xxx, xxx, and xxx for their comments on the
