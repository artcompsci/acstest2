= Writing the Code

== Choosing a Computer Language

*Carol*:
Let's start coding!  Which language shall we use to write a computer code?
I bet you physics types insist on using Fortran.

*Erica*:
Believe it or not, most of the astrophysics code I'm familiar with has
been written in C++.  It may not be exactly my favorite, but it is at
least widely available, well supported, and likely to stay with us for
decades.

*Dan*:
What is C++, and why the obscure name?  Makes the notion of an N-body
problem seem like clarity itself!

*Carol*:
Long story.  I don't know whether there was ever a language A, but
there certainly was a language B, which was followed alphabetically by
a newer language C, which became quite popular.  Then C was extended
to a new language for object-oriented programming, something we'll
talk about later.  In a nerdy pun, the increment operation ``++'' from
the C language was used to indicate that C++ was the successor
language to C.

*Dan*:
But everybody I know seems to be coding in Java.

*Carol*:
Java has a clear advantage over C++ in being almost platform independent,
but frankly, I don't like either C++ or Java.  Recently, I took a
course in which the instructor used a scripting language, Ruby.
And I was surprised at the flexible way in which I could
quickly express rather complex ideas in Ruby.

*Erica*:
Does Ruby have something like STL?

*Carol*:
You mean the Standard Template Library in C++?  Ruby doesn't need any
such complications because it is already dynamically typed from
the start!

*Dan*:
I have no idea what the two of you are talking about, but I agree with
Carol, let's start coding, in whatever language!

== Choosing an Algorithm

*Carol*:
We want to write a simulation code, to enable us to simulate the
behavior of stars that move under the influence of gravity.  So
far we have derived the equations of motion for the relative position
of one particle with respect to the other.  What we need now is an
algorithm to integrate these equations.

*Dan*: What does it mean to integrate an equation?

*Carol*: We are dealing with differential equations.  In calculus,
differentiation is the opposite of integration.  If you differentiate
an expression, and then integrate it again, you get the same expression
back, apart from a constant.  Our differential equations describe the
time derivatives of position and velocity.  In order to obtain the
actual values for the position and velocity as a function of time, we
have to integrate the differential equation.

*Erica*:
And to do so, we need an integration algorithm.  And yes,
there is a large choice!  If you pick up any book on
numerical methods, you will see that you can select from a variety of
lower-order and higher-order integrators, and for each one there are
additional choices as to the precise structure of the algorithm.

*Dan*:
What is the order of an algorithm?

*Erica*:
It signifies the rate of convergence.  Since no algorithm with a
finite time step size is perfect, they all make numerical errors.
In a fourth-order algorithm, for example, this error scales as the
fourth power of the time step -- hence the name fourth order.

*Carol*:
If that is the case, why not take a tenth order or even a twentieth
order algorithm.  By only slightly reducing the time step, we would
read machine accuracy, of order <tex>$10^{-15}$</tex> for the usual double
precision (8 byte, i.e. 64 bit) representation of floating point numbers.

*Erica*:
The drawback of using high-order integrators is two-fold: first, they
are far more complex to code; and secondly, they do not allow arbitrarily
large time steps, since their region of convergence is limited.  As a
consequence, there is an optimal order for each type of problem.  When
you want to integrate a relatively well-behaved system, such as the
motion of the planets in the solar system, a twelfth-order integrator
may well be optimal.  Since all planets follow well-separated orbits,
there will be no sudden surprises there.  But when you integrate a
star cluster, where some of the stars can come arbitrarily close to each
other, experience shows that very high order integrators lose their edge.
In practice, fourth-order integrators have been used most often for the job.

*Dan*:
How about starting with the lowest-order integrator we can think of?
A zeroth-order integrator would make no sense, since the error would
remain constant, independent of the time step size.  So the simplest
one must be a first-order integrator.

*Erica*:
Indeed.  And the simplest version of a first-order integrator is
called the <i>forward Euler</i> integrator.

*Dan*:
Was Euler so forward-looking, or is there also a <i>backward Euler</i>
algorithm?

*Erica*:
There is indeed.  In the forward version, at each time step you simply
take a step tangential to the orbit you are on.  After that, at the
next step, the new value of the acceleration forces you to slightly
change direction, and again you move for a time step <tex>$dt$</tex>
in a straight line in that direction.  Your approximate orbit is thus
constructed out of a number of straight line segments, where each one
has the proper direction at the beginning of the segment, but the
wrong one at the end.

:figure: forward1.eps 6cm forward1
The forward Euler approximation is indicated by the straight arrows,
while the curved lines show the true solutions to the differential equation.

*Dan*:
And the <i>backward Euler</i> algorithm must have the right direction
at the end of a time step, and the wrong one at the beginning.  Let's
see.  That seems much harder to construct.  How do you know at the
beginning of a time step in what direction to move so that you come
out with the right direction tangential to a correct orbit at that
point?

:figure: backward1.eps 6cm backward1
As figure ref(forward1), but now for the backward Euler approximation.

*Erica*:
You do that through iteration.  You guess a direction, and
then you correct for the mistake you find yourself making, so that
your second iteration is much more accurate, in fact first-order
accurate.  Given this extra complexity, I suggest that we start with
the forward Euler algorithm.

*Carol*:
Can't we do both, _ie_ make half the mistakes of each of the two, while
trying to strike the right balance between forward and backward Euler?

*Erica*:
Aha!  That is a good way to construct better algorithms, which then
become second-order accurate, because you have canceled the first-order
errors.  Examples are second-order Runge Kutta, and leapfrog.  We'll
soon come to that, but for now let's keep it simple, and stay with
first order.  Here is the mathematical notation:

:eqnarray:
\label{ForwardEulerStep}
\br_{i+1} & = & \br_i + \bv_i dt    \nonumber \\
\bv_{i+1} & = & \bv_i + \ba_i dt

for the position <tex>$\br$</tex> and velocity <tex>$\bv$</tex> of an individual particle,
where the index <tex>$i$</tex> indicates the values for time <tex>$t_i$</tex> and <tex>$i+1$</tex> for
the time <tex>$t_{i+1}$</tex> after one more time step has been taken:
<tex>$dt = t_{i+1} - t_i$</tex>.  The acceleration induced on a particle by the
gravitational forces of all other particles is indicated by <tex>$\ba$</tex>.
So, all we have to do now is to code it up.  By the way, let's rename
the file.  Rather than a generic name <tt>nbody.rb</tt>, let's call it
<tt>euler.rb</tt>, or even better <tt>euler_try.rb</tt>.  After all,
most likely we'll make a mistake, or two, or more, before we're finished!

== Specifying Initial Conditions

*Carol*: I have learned that in order to solve a differential equation,
you have to provide initial conditions.

*Erica*: Yes.  It is like using a map: if you don't know where you are,
you can't use it.  You start with the spot marked "you are here", and then
you can start walking, using the knowledge given by the map.

In our case, a differential equation tells you how a system evolves,
from one point to the next.  Once you know where you are at time
<tt>0</tt>, the equation tells you where you will move to, and how, in
subsequent times.

So we have to specify the initial separation between the particles.
How about a simple choice like this?

:eqnarray:
 \br &=& \{x, y, z\} = \{1, 0, 0\}                    \nonumber \\
 \bv &=& \{v_x, v_y, v_z\} = \{0, 0.5, 0\}

*Dan*: Let me put this into words.
The relative position vector is chosen along the <tex>$x$</tex> axis
at a distance of one from the origin.  The origin is the place where
the other particle resides, and it is the origin of the relative
coordinate system that we use.  And the relative velocity is chosen to be
<tex>$0.5$</tex> in the direction of the positive <tex>$y$</tex> axis.
This means that the initial motion is at right angles to the initial
separation.

*Carol*: Would it not be easier to use a position of
<tex>$\br = \{1, 0\}$</tex> and a velocity of <tex>$\bv = \{0, 0.5\}$</tex>,
in other words, to work in two dimensions?

*Erica*: Well, as soon as we will do anything connected with the real
universe, we will have to go to 3D, so why not just start there, even
though the two-body problem is essential a 2D problem.

*Dan*: I don't care, either way, let's just move on.  We have to translate
what Erica has just written into computer code.  If it were Fortran, I would
start writing the first line as

  x = 1

*Erica*: That is how you would do it in C or C++ as well, although you first
would have to declare the type of +x+, by specifying that it is a number,
in our case a floating point number, even though we initialize it here
with an integer.  The meaning of the equal sign, <tt>=</tt>, can be
interpreted as follows: the value of the right-hand side of the equation
gets assigned to the variable that appears at the left-hand side.  In this
case, the value of the right-hand side is already clear, it is just 1,
and after execution of this statement, the variable +x+ has acquired the
value 1.

*Carol*: In Ruby you do the same as in Fortran or C or C++, or Java for that
matter.  In general, Ruby is designed around the `principle of least surprise.'
If you have some experience with computer languages, you will find
that whenever you encounter something new in Ruby, it is not too far
from what you might have guessed.

*Erica*: So assignment is exactly the same as in C?

*Carol*: The assignment itself is exactly the same, but there is no need to
declare anything.

*Erica*: Really?  How does Ruby now that the variable +x+ can hold a floating
point number and not, say, a character string or an array or whatever?

*Carol*: In Ruby there is no need for variable declaration, simply because
there is nothing to declare: variables have no intrinsic type.  The type of
a variable is whatever you assign to it.  If you write <tt>x = 3.14</tt>,
+x+ becomes a floating point number; and if you then write <tt>x = "abs"</tt>,
it becomes a string.  This freedom and flexibility is expressed by saying
that Ruby is a dynamically typed language.

*Erica*: Isn't that dangerous?

*Carol*: I expected it would be, but in my experience, I in fact
made fewer mistakes using Ruby than using so-called strongly typed
languages, such as C and C++.  Or stated more precisely: what mistakes
I made, I could catch far more quickly, since it would be rather
obvious if you assign <tt>pi = "abc"</tt> and then try to compute
<tt>2*pi*r</tt> and the like: you would get an error message telling
you that a string cannot be forced into a number.

*Erica*: so this means that we can just list the six assignments for
<tex>$\br = \{1, 0, 0\}$</tex> and <tex>$\bv = \{0, 0.5, 0\}$</tex>?
Like one line for each assignment?

*Carol*: You can write several assignments on one line, separated
by semicolons, but I prefer to keep it simple and do it one per line.
Here they are:

 :inccode: .euler_try.rb-1

By the way, does this specific choice of initial conditions mean that the
two particles will move around each other in a circle?

*Erica*: Probably not, unless we give exactly the right velocity
needed for circular motion.  In general, the orbit will take the shape
of an ellipse, if the two particles are bound.  If the initial speed
is too high, the particles escape from each other, in a parabolic or
hyperbolic orbit.

*Dan*: Starting from the initial conditions, we have to step forward in time.
I have no idea how large the time step step +dt+ should be.

*Carol*: But at least we can argue that it should not be too large.
The distance +dr+ over which the particles travel during a time step
+dt+ must be very small compared to the separation between the two
particles:

:equation:
dr = v\ dt \ll r

With <tex>$v=1$</tex> and <tex>$r=1$</tex>, this means
<tex>$dt\ll 1$</tex>.

*Dan*: In that case, we could take `much less than 1' to mean 0.1,
for starters.

*Carol*: I would prefer an even smaller value.  Looking at fig. (ref(forward1))
we see how quickly the forward Euler scheme flies off the tracks, so to speak.
How about letting `much less than 1' be 0.01?  We can always make it
larger later:

 :inccode: .euler_try.rb-2

== Looping in Ruby
:label: looping

*Erica*: We now know where we start in space, and with what velocity.
We also know the size of each time step.  All we have to do is start
taking steps.

*Dan*: With a tiny time step of <tex>$dt = 0.01$</tex>, we'll have to take
at least a hundred steps to see much happening, I guess.  And to go a bit
further, say from time <tex>$t = 0$</tex> to time <tex>$t = 10$</tex>, we
will need a thousand steps.

*Erica*: That means we have to construct a loop.  Something like `for
<tex>$i=1$</tex> till <tex>$i=1000$</tex> do something.'  At least that
is how most computer languages express it.  I wonder how ruby does it.

*Carol*: Let's have a look at the Ruby book.  How do you repeat the same
thing +k+ times?  Ah, here it is.  That looks funny!  You write
<tt>k.times</tt>!  So to traverse a piece of code <tex>$1000$</tex> times,
you enclose that piece of code within the following loop wrapper:

 :inccode: .euler_try.rb-3

*Dan*: Surely you are joking!  That is carrying the principle of least
surprise a bit too far to believe.  How can that work?  Can a computer
language really stay so close to English?

*Carol*: The key seems to be that Ruby is an object-oriented language.
Each `thing' in ruby is an object, which can have attributes such as
perhaps internal data or internal methods, which may or may not be
visible from the outside.

*Dan*: What is a method?

*Carol*: In Ruby, the word _method_ is used for a piece of code that
can be called from another place in a longer code.  In Fortran, you call
that a _subroutine_, while in C and C++ you call it a _function_.  In
Ruby, it is called a _method_.

*Erica*: I have heard the term `object-oriented programming.'  I really
should browse through the Ruby book, to get a bit more familiar with that
approach.

*Dan*: We all should.  But for now, Carol, how does your key work?
Is the number <tex>$1000$</tex> also an object?

*Carol*: You guessed it!  And every number has by default various methods
associated with it.  One method happens to be called +times+.

*Erica*: And what +times+ does is repeat the content of its argument,
whatever is within the curly brackets, +k+ times, if the number is +k+.

*Carol*: Precisely.  A bunch of expressions between curly brackets is
called a block in Ruby, and this block is executed +k+ times.  We will
have to get used to the main concepts of Ruby as we go along, but if
you want to read about Ruby in more systematic way, here is a
<web>http://www.rubycentral.com/|a good place to start</web>, and here
is a web site specifically aimed at
<web>http://sciruby.codeforpeople.com/|scientific applications</web>.

== Interactive Ruby: +irb+

*Dan*: Amazing.  Well, I would be even more amazed to see this work.

*Carol*: Let's test it out, using +irb+.  This is an interactive program
that allows you to test little snippets of Ruby code.  Let us explore what
it can do for us.  You can invoke it simply by typing its name:

 :commandinputoutputnoecho: irb END
quit
END

and you can get out at any time by typing +quit+.

*Dan*: I like your prompt!

*Carol*: Well, I called my computer `gravity', and I set up my shell
to echo the name of my computer, so that's why it shows up here.

*Dan*: Quite appropriate.  Now how do we interact with +irb+?

It seems that we can now type any Ruby expression, which will then be
evaluated right away.  Let me try something simple:

 :commandinputoutputnoecho: irb END
2 + 3
quit
END

*Erica*: How about going from arithmetic to algebra, by using some variables?

 :commandinputoutputnoecho: irb END
a = 4
b = 5
c = a * b
quit
END

I see.  At the end of each line, the result of the operation is echoed.
And the value 20 is now assigned to the variable +c+.

*Carol*: Indeed.  Time to test Ruby's looping construct:

 :commandinputoutputnoecho: irb END
c = 20
3.times{ c += 1 }
c
quit
END

Perfect!  We started with 20 and three times we added 1.

*Dan*: ah, so <tt>c += 1</tt> is the same as <tt>c = c + 1</tt>?

*Carol*: Yes.  This is a construction used in C, and since taken over
by various other languages.  It applies for many operators, not only
addition.  For example, <tt>c *= d</tt> is the same as <tt>c = c * d</tt>.

== Compiled vs. Interpreted vs. Interactive

*Erica*: This +irb+ program is quite useful clearly, but I'm puzzled
about the various ways in which we can use Ruby.  We are now writing
a Ruby program, by adding lines to a file, in just the same way we
would be writing a C or Fortran program, yes?

*Carol*: Yes and no.  Yes, it looks the same, but no, it really is a
quite different approach.  Ruby is an interpreted language, while C
and Fortran, and C++ as well, are all compiled languages.  In Ruby,
there is no need to compile a source code file; you can just run it
directly, as we will see soon.

This, by the way, is why Ruby is called a scripting language, like
Perl and Python.  In all three cases, whatever you write can be run
right away, just like a shell script.  As soon as we have finished
writing our program, we will run it with the command <tt>ruby</tt> in
front of the file name, in the same way as you would run a cshell
script by typing <tt>csh filename</tt>.  In our case we will type
<tt>ruby euler_try.rb</tt>.

*Erica*: So the difference is that in C you first compile each piece of
source code into object modules, and then you link those modules into
a single executable file, and then you run that file -- whereas in Ruby
the script itself is executable.

*Carol*: Exactly.

*Erica*: But what is the difference between typing +ruby+ and typing
+irb+?  If the +ruby+ command interprets each line as it goes along,
what does +irb+ add?

*Carol*: The difference is the +i+ in +irb+, which stands for _interactive_.
In the case of +irb+, each line is not only interpreted, it is also
evaluated and the result is printed on the screen.  In this way, you
can look into the mind of the interpreter, so to speak, and you can
follow step by step what is going on.

*Dan*: It sounds a bit like going into a debug mode.

*Carol*: I guess you could say that, yes.  However, if you run a Ruby
script using the command +ruby+, you only get results on the screen
when you give a specific print command, such as +print+, as we will
see.

And just to give full disclosure, there is another hitch.  If you are
starting to write a loop, say, you may have included an open parenthesis,
but not yet a closing parenthesis.  In +irb+ that is no problem; in fact,
the prompt will change, to indicate that you are one or more levels deep
inside nested expressions.  But if you try to run such an incomplete file
with the +ruby+ command, you will get an error message, even before the
Ruby interpreter starts.

Here is what happens.  Upon typing <tt>ruby some-file.rb</tt>, a syntax
check is being carried out on the file <tt>some-file.rb</tt>.  If the
parentheses are not balanced, a syntax error is produced, and the real
interpreter part of Ruby is not even started up.

*Dan*: Just like what happens in Fortran, when you get a compile error!

*Carol*: Yes, in a way.  And to make things more confusing, many people
tend to call such an error a `compile error', even when working with
Ruby, even though in Ruby the code is not really compiled, strictly
speaking.  The problem is that so-called compile errors in compiled
languages are really syntax errors; and interpreted languages can of
course have syntax errors as well.  So when you hear someone telling
you `my Ruby (or Perl and Python) program didn't compile,' they mean
`my script had syntax errors.'  However, strictly speaking, Ruby
initially parses the input program and transform it to a tree
structure, and then the interpreter actually traces this tree
structure, not the text string itself.  So it is not entirely
incorrect to say that ruby first "compiles" a program.  But this is
probably more than what you would want to know at this point.

== One Step at a Time

*Erica*: All that is left for us to do is to write the content of the loop.
That means we have to describe how to take a single step forward in time.

Specifically, at the start we have to tell the particles how
to move to their next relative position, from our starting point of time
<tex>$t=0$</tex> to <tex>$t=0.01$</tex>, in our case.  Or for a
general +dt+ value, using the forward Euler approximation
(ref(ForwardEulerStep)), we obtain the position
<tex>$\br = \{r_x, r_y, r_z\}$</tex> at the end of the first step:

 :inccode: .euler_try.rb-4

In addition, we have to tell the particles what their new relative velocity
<tex>$\bv = \{v_x, v_y, v_z\}$</tex>
should be.  Using the same forward Euler construction, we can write:

 :inccode: .euler_try.rb-5

using the acceleration vector <tex>$\ba = \{a_x, a_y, a_z\}$</tex>.

*Dan*: But we haven't calculated the acceleration +a+ yet!

*Carol*: This is an important example of code writing, something called
`wishful thinking' or `wishful programming'.  You start writing a code
as if you already have the main ingredients in hand, and then you go
back and fill in the commands needed to compute those ingredients.

*Dan*: That sounds like a top-down programming approach, which makes sense:
I like to start with an overview of what needs to be done.  It is all too
easy to start from the bottom up, only to get lost while trying to put all
the pieces together.

*Erica*: To compute the acceleration, we have to solve the differential
equation for the Newtonian two-body problem, Eq. (ref(Newton2bodysimple)).
I will copy it here again:

:equation:
\ba = - \frac{\br}{r^3}

*Dan*: Can you write it out in component notation?

*Erica*: Sure:

:eqnarray:
\label{axayaz}
a_x &=& - \frac{x}{r^3}    \nonumber \\
a_y &=& - \frac{y}{r^3}    \nonumber \\
a_z &=& - \frac{z}{r^3}

where the magnitude of the separation <tex>$r$</tex> is defined as

:equation:
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}

Let me start with the last line.  Since we will often need the
square of the scalar distance between the particles, we may as
well first compute <tex>$r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$</tex>:

 :inccode: .euler_try.rb-6

*Carol*: Let's see whether I remember my vector analysis class.  The quantity
<tex>$\br$</tex> is called a vector, and the quantity <tex>$r$</tex> is called
a scalar, right?

*Erica*: Indeed.  The last quantity is a scalar because it is independent of
your choice of coordinate system.  If we rotate out coordinates, the values
of <tex>$x$</tex> and of <tex>$y$</tex> and of <tex>$z$</tex> may all change,
and therefore <tex>$\br$</tex> will change.  However, <tex>$r$</tex> will
stay the same, and that is a good thing: it denotes the physical distance
between the particles, something that you can measure.  When two people use
two different coordinate systems, and both measure <tex>$r$</tex>, the value
they find had better be the same.

*Dan*: My Ruby book tells me that you must add the line

 :inccode: .euler_try.rb-7

in order to use the square root method +sqrt+, where the term method
is used in the same way the word function is used in C and the word
subroutine is used in Fortran.  The <tt>include</tt> statement is
needed to gain access to the +Math+ module in Ruby, where
many of the mathematical methods reside.

*Erica*: Thanks!  Now the rest is straightforward.  To code up
Eq. (ref(axayaz)), we first need to determine <tex>$r^3$</tex>,
and a simple way to do that is to write it as a product of two
express we have already found: <tex>$r^3 = r^2r$</tex>:

 :inccode: .euler_try.rb-8

== Printing the Result

*Dan*: Shall we see whether the program works, so far?  Let's run it!

*Erica*: Small point, but . . . perhaps we should add a print statement,
to get the result on the screen?

*Carol*: I guess that doesn't hurt!  The Ruby syntax for printing is
very intuitive, following the Ruby notion of the `principle of least surprise':

 :inccode: .euler_try.rb-9

*Erica*: I like that principle!  And indeed, this couldn't be simpler!

*Dan*: Apart from this mysterious <tt>\n</tt> at the end.  What does that do?

*Carol*: It prints a new line.  This notation is borrowed from the C language.
By the way, I'd like to see a printout of the position and velocity at the
start of the run as well, before we enter the loop, so that we get all the
points, from start to finish.

*Erica*: Fine!  Here it is, our first program, <tt>euler_try.rb</tt>, which
is supposed to evolve our two-body problem for ten time units, from
<tt>t = 0</tt> till <tt>t = 10</tt>:

 :inccode: .euler_try.rb
