Fine!

Sure, that was just to make myself clear, anything shorter is fine and
probably better.

Great!  I tested it, and I realized that it works only for

  :include: .somename.rb

and not for 

  :include: somename.rb

(without the initial dot).  That is fine with me: it is probably a
good habit to always use a dot (even though I often still forget).
Perhaps I made that mistake when I tested the tabs las time.
