There can be commas in some URL, though the formal specification does
not allow it. So probably we need a slightly different syntax. How
about "|", like

  <web>xxx|online version</web>

Here, instead of the *first* comma, we can use *last* "|". This means
you cannot use  "|" in the link label. Do you mind?  

By the way, I think "acswebref" is unnecessarily long.

I *think* this is now done.
