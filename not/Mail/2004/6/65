Done.

Will do.

Thanks for the explanation!  Yes, we have been changing the numbers
quite a bit.  Of course, each time we change, I am much more happy
with the new numbering, and I think that from that point on, we will
keep the numbering fixed . . . ;>).

We can discuss the linking of references when we meet on Wednesday.
One question is whether we should/could give section numbers to rdoc.

I am including your message below, and sending it to the "not" email
address, in order to add it to our lab notes.

Piet,

Great! Two small points:

a) In "Why So Many Volumes?", "We now consider hundred volumes ..."
   may sounds a bit unrealistic, even though that may be
   realistic. How about "several tens of volumes"?

b) Since we have "I am an amateur astronomer. Is this for me?",
   perhaps we should also have "I am an astronomy
   student/postdoc/.... Is this for me?", or something like that.

Okay, I'll make something.

As far as we keep rdoc same, this is the safe way.

Well, technically speaking it is easy. One problem is perhaps
that you have been changing the volume number quite a bit.

Currently, for example, the HTML file for the first section of book 1a
looks like:

-----------------------------------------------------------
<div class="description"><h1>Setting the Stage</h1>
<p>
<a name=rdocsect6>
</p>
-----------------------------------------------------------
The name tag is added to make the table of content. The numbering is
automatic.  So it is relatively easy to translate an expression like:

crosslink(vol-1a/ch01/"Setting the Stage")

to appropriate HTML link. However, there are several practical
implementation problems:

a) How to uniquely specify, for example, the section name. It is quite
   possible that a same section or subsection name appears multiple
   times in one volume.

   In latex the problem is solved by letting the user to specify a
   unique label to anything to be referred. We can take that approach
   if you like, by, for example, writing

   = Setting the Stage
   <name>Name-here-must-be-unique-over-entire-ACS-or-Kali</name>

   This will be transrated to 

   <h1>Setting the Stage</h1>
   <p>
   <a name=Name-here-must-be-unique-over-entire-ACS-or-Kali>
   </p>

   and we could refer to it by, for example,

   globallink(Name-here-must-be-unique-over-entire-ACS-or-Kali)

   or

   globallink(Name-here-must-be-unique-over-entire-ACS-or-Kali, ../)

   to specify that you want to search for all volumes under the parent
   directory of the current volume.

b) How to handle the possible changes to the volume name, file name
   etc, when you divide one book into two or shuffle the ordering of
   the book.

   Actually, as you can see, requesting the global name for the place
   to be referenced does solve this problem as well.

c) How the link should appear in the text? I mean, what should we
   specify for "X"  below? 

      <a href=....#Name-here-must-be-unique-over-entire-ACS-or-Kali>X</a>
   
   In latex, sections are numbered, so the solution was easy. In
   acsdoc, sections are not numbered, nor the volumes (well, at least
   not in a stable way). So it is not clear what to write at "X". We
   could write:

      "Volume 1a, Chapter 01, Section  Setting the Stage"
   
   But I'm not sure if that is the best way or not.

d) In PS or TeX version there is no way to cross referensing to other
   books. So what should we do there?

I think that's right. The best way is to test it...

No.
