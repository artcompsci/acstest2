Jun,

I agree.  That is a very clear analysis.  Okay, I will let Alice argue
for something like that.

Practically speaking, I do not think there is any other choice. In
general, at any time in future, we will be adding volumes in the
middle of the series. If we have N previous volumes, I think the
probability that some inconsistency occurs between the new volume and
old one is proportional to N (or something like 1-exp(-cN)). The
amount of work to make everything consistemt is at least O(N) (for
checking the consistency). So the cost of adding one volume would be
O(N^2), and total cost of N volumes would become O(N^3), if we try to
keep all volumes always consistent. In other words, we cannot go any
further than, say, 10 volumes, which is almost exactly where we are
now.

Well, only if you assume a fixed linear ordering between volumes. If
that is lost, there is really no way to make volumes consistent other
than full O(N^3) correction.

Well, one way would be Alice starts to argue for the complete
consistency, but while talking finds that it's next to impossible...
