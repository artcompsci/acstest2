You can read the many ACS volumes of dialogues directly on the
<a href=../index.html>ACS web site</a>, and you can also copy
one volume at a time, in postcript or pdf form, by clicking on the
"ps" or "pdf" lines, listed after each volume, for example on the
<a href=../kali/index.html>Kali home page</a>.  However, if you would
like to use the computer codes that are discussed in those volumes,
you will need to install a local version of ACS on your own computer.
<p>
To install an ACS version on your computer, follow the
instructions below.  So far, we only have experience with installing
ACS on Unix machines, where we depend on running a C shell.  We hope
to extend this choice at some point in the future (and we invite
others to help us to port ACS to different platforms and environments).
<ul>
<li>
To start with, choose a tar ball corresponding to the
<a href=index.html>latest ACS release</a>.
There are typically two versions, a full `acs' version and a smaller
`acs-lite' version.  For a discussion of the differences, see the
description following our <a href=index.html#acs10>first release</a>.
<p>
<li>
Go to the directory where you want to install the ACS
package.  A typical choice would be just to go to your login directory
"~name" if "name" is your login name.  For this choice, just type "cd".
Then copy your prefered tar ball to this place.
<p>
<li>
Untar the tar ball, by typing "tar zxf acs-xxx.tgz" or
"tar zxf acs-lite-xxx.tgz" where xxx is the 
version number of the tar ball you just copied in [note: this
procedure is valid for ACS versions 1.2 or later].  After untarring
has finished, if you type "ls" you will see that a new directory "acs"
has been created.  All ACS files live in the directory tree starting
at this directory.
<p>
<li>
Now give the environment variable name ACSROOT to this new directory.
For example, if your chosen directory was "~name", the acs root
directory will be called "~name/acs", and in that case you have to add
the following line to your .cshrc file:<br>
<blockquote>
setenv ACSROOT ~name/acs
</blockquote>
or whatever "~name/acs" expands to (perhaps "/home/name/acs").
<p>
<li>
In addition, you should add the following line to your .cshrc file:
<blockquote>
source $ACSROOT/bin/acsstart.cshrc
</blockquote>
This will guarantee that your command search path will include
the appropriate ACS files.
<p>
<li>
Now type "make acscode".  This command will install the proper code
files into the library and source directories (Note that there are
different ways to run the Ruby codes, either by using the standard
"<tt>ruby some_code.rb</tt>" command, or by using our special
"<tt>Kali some_code</tt>" command -- see the discussion in the
<a href=../kali/vol/code_management/doc/files/_/_title_ok.html>Code
Management</a> volume).
<p>
<li>
In general, each code file "xxx.rb" can be found in the directory
where its use is first mentioned.  For example, "nbody_sh1.rb" can
be found in directory "$ACSROOT/kali/vol/shared_timesteps", where
the original file lives.  A copy of it will be automatically installed
in "$ACSROOT/bin/kali".  It is this copy that is visible throughout the
kali system, and that can be run using the command "Kali", which is a
shorthand for "ruby" which tells Ruby where to look for the appropriate
source and library files.
<p>
For example, the command: "Kali nbody_sh1.rb ---help"
should produce a short description of the code.
<p>
<li>
If you have choosen an "acs-lite" tar file, none of the documentation, in
terms of the dialogue volumes in html, ps or pdf form, will be present.
You can generate all documentation files, in all three forms, by following
these steps -- but note that this may take a rather long time, and
that it requires the presence on your computer of various other
packages, such as ImageMagick; if you don't have those, or if you
don't want to wait for hours, you may want
to download the full "acs" version instead, in which all volumes have
already been compiled.  The steps to compile the volumes from the
"acs-lite" tar file are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Type "cd $ACSROOT/src/rdoc*"
<p>
<li>
Become superuser, by typing "su", and as superuser, type "ruby install.rb"
<p>
<li>
Return to the $ACSROOT directory, by typing "cd $ACSROOT"
<p>
<li>
Type "make", which will construct the html, ps, and pdf
versions of the manuscript.
</ul>
</ul>
