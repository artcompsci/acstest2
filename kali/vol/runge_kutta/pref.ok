= Preface

In this volume, we present a pedagogic overview of the freedom one has
in choosing the coefficients in explicit Runge-Kutta integration
schemes.  We limit ourselves to the simple cases in which there are at
most two new evaluations of the right-hand side of the differential
equation per time step.  We start with first-order differential
equations, to explain the general procedures, but then we specially to
a special case of the type of second-order differential equation that
occurs in classical mechanics, where the forces are dependent only on
positions, and independent of the velocities.  In that case we derive
some of the classical <tex>Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om</tex> schemes, and
generalize this to include a first evaluation that does not take place
at the beginning of a time step.  We show how such a generalized
approach naturally leads us to the
<tex>leapfrog-Verlet-St\"ormer-Delambre</tex> scheme, as a particular
form of a generalized explicit Runge-Kutta scheme.
