The lazy way to change the timestamp files of all rdoc labnote files:
	
tmp.awk:

 {
   print $2, $3, substr($1, length($1)-1,99), $5, $6, $7
 }

 cat tmp.csh

 foreach f ( lab*)
   (echo -n $f " " ; cat .${f}) | awk -f tmp.awk > xx
   mv  xx .${f}
   cat .${f}
   echo end $f
 end

To create the entire labnote entry, you would do:

   422  16:24   ruby ../src/labnotes/combine-notes.rb combined/2003-12-all */2003/12/*[0-9]
   423  16:24   ruby ../src/labnotes/combine-notes.rb combined/2003-11-all */2003/11/*[0-9]
   424  16:24   rdoc combined/*

Made command update-lab

Now you need to define ACSROOT to be the top level directory name,
under which you have "not" directory.

Modification for src/c*p*/acsdoc.rb:

Need to define directives for segments. One way:


 :segment start: segment_name
 ...
 ...
 :segment end:<br>

This should allow correctly nested segments like

  :segment start: segment_name
  ...
  :segment start: segment_name1
  ...
  ...
  :segment end:
  ...
  :segment start: segment_name2
  ...
  ...
  :segment end:
  ...
  :segment end:


acsdoc.rb then creates files with name like
 .filename-segment_name

which you can then include by
saying:include:   .filename-segment_name

We could have a convention to transform, for example,
 filename:segment  after :include code: to .filename-segment.
This may be slightly easier to use

The RDOC format seems to have rather interesting "feature", that is,
the text (paragraph) is filled only when the line starts with
non-whitespace. 

漢字を書くと何が起こるのかな？

Well, the default language type seems to be iso-8859-1, which is a bit
unfortunate...

Actually, by passing --charset=EUC-JP to rdoc, you can make japanese
document as well. Currently, I hacked update-lab so that it gives the
correct --charset option when LANG=ja_JP.eucJP (and only when). SJIS
and JIS are not handled correctly right now.
