= More changes to acsdoc.

 What I did: convert "^" and "\" to "$\hat{\ }" and $\backslash" etc.

This would allow us to write these symbols in normal, justified text.
For codes ("verbatim" part), they are allowed by latex itself.

A tricky problem is how we handle inequality signs, namely

  < and >

In typewriter  font (and perhaps therefore in verbatim mode),

One bug fixed : decreasing indent for verbatim

One bug created: In itemized or enumerate mode, if one goes to
verbatim, decreasing the indentation cannot make it back to the
original mode. Need some change in the logic to go back to the
original mode.

Table of content: where to put it?

One possibility: If a title page file (title.cp) is there, put it at
the last.

But clearly not all documents contain title.cp. In fact, in standard
usage you might have just a single file.

The other possibility: the : tableofcontent : directive is used to
insert it, to whatever file you like.

This directive itself is already there.
