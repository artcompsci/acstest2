== More on acsdoc

Tex stuff is more or less working with current acsdoc.rb, though there
are strange problems in the way rdoc handle link: file stuff.

Thing to be done

* configuration file to set
   * the image size
   * location of commands like dvips, netpbm etc

* some error message capability?

* capability to translate to rd. This is useful to generalte tex.

* How to implement translation from cp to rd?

  * from cp to some abstract or interpreted format to
    rd or rdoc
  * from cp directly to rd using differnt command than acsdoc
  * from acsdoc output to rd.

  The third option would not actually work, sicen acsdoc output has
  already converted inlined tex sources to images.

  So the only viable options are the first and second ones. Well, the
  first one is cleaner, and perhaps actually easier to implement.

  Well, a very different possibility is to translate directly to
  latex, which may actually be simpler to do.

  Ths can be done by implementing the conversion from preprocessed
  rdoc format to latex, before passed to find-and-process-tex-inlines in
  acsdoc.rb, as completely separate stuff. This is a reasonably clean
  implementation for independent paths to make outputs in different
  format.
