== More on acsdoc

Tex stuff is more or less working with current acsdoc.rb, though there
are strange problems in the way rdoc handle link: file stuff.

Thing to be done

* configulation file to set
   * the image size
   * location of commands like dvips, netpbm etc

* some error message capability?
