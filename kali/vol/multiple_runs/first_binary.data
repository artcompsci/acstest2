Here are the data from the runs that we performed with ACS in April 2005,
to determine the time of first hard binary formation.  Given here are for
each particle number N the median time T for first binary formation, with
Delta T which is the one-sigma error in T:


  N       T    Delta T

  3      72      13
  4      16.0     2.8
  5      17.0     3.0
  6      20.0     3.5
  7      15.5     2.7
  8      11.0     1.9
  9      11.5     2.0
 12      11.5     2.0
