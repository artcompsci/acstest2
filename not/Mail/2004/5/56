Piet,

I added some more functionalities to acsdoc.rb.

One is to support numbered equations and references to them.

The following:

:equation:
\label{equation1}
a = b

(blanck line is recognized as the end of equation) is essentially the
same as writing

<tex>
\begin{equation}
\label{equation1}
a = b
\end{equation}
</tex>

but equation number is maintained within acsdoc.rb. To refer to
an equation, use ref(equation1). equation label must be composed of
alphanumerics and ":". "_" or any other symbol is currently illegal.

I also added numbered figures, in the form

:figure: name_of_the_figure_file size label
caption text for the figure.

Here again, label can be refered by ref(label). Size is used by latex
as the width of the figure. Figure file can be eps, jpeg, or whatever
imagemagic convert command can handle.

Example is in $ACSROOT/src/coherent_programming/sample2.cp. To use this,
you need to re-install rdoc from acs local copy,  by

cd $ACSROOT/src/rdoc-0.9.0acs1
su
ruby install.rb

I'm sure you'll find problems and bugs. So if you have time to try,
try it and let me know what problems you see.
