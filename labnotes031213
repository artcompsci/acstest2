1. Vector class

As an exercise, I implemented a three-dimensional vector class, in the
file "vector1.rb", which I then used in our ruby integrator in the file
"nbody_sh1_vector1.rb".  By defining +,-, etc. operators, the pairwise
interaction function now looks much simpler.

At first, I did not use any array in the vector class, to see what
difference that would make.  In that case, the integrator runs slower
by about 50% compared to the original "nbody_sh1.rb".

I then modified the vector class by using arrays instead, in the file
"vector2.rb", which I used in the integrator "nbody_sh1_vector2.rb".
I'm pretty sure I did not do this optimally, since I still ran into
problems with copying objects; I found a solution but I probably used
too clumsy a method.  In any case, this array method ran even slower,
about 100% slower compared to the original "nbody_sh1.rb".
