  title: The Maya Open Lab For Dense Stellar Systems
  description: |
    The Maya project is documented in the Maya Development Series,
    centered around dialogues between two astrophysicists, Alice and
    Bob, who are developing the Kali code for simulating dense stellar
    systems.  In the process, they construct an open lab, Maya, to set
    up initial conditions, run the Kali code, and analyze the results.
    The Maya School Series provides students with self-study material,
    as a more compact way to learn how to model dense stellar systems.
