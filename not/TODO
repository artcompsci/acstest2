= TODO for acs

Time-stamp: <2004-04-09 12:15:37 piet>

* in our labnotes and elsewhere, how/when shall we implement reference
  pointers?

* specifically, we need references (and a mechanics to keep them up-to-date
  in both directions!) for the following notion: we may want to give
  guided tours and explanations of short-cuts as a separate track of
  text in the book, apart from the dialogues.  This could be as
  preface, appendices, and comments at the end of each chapter

* how about replacing

  <tt>segment start: <i>name</i></tt>

  by 

  <tt>segment: <i>name</i></tt>

  ?

* a cleanup mechanism for all the <tt>.something</tt> files?

* there is something wrong with the numbering in <tt>labnotes031112</tt>:
  the top level sections are always 1.

* in our book, we may want to say a few more words about the notion of
  the `order' of a differential equation?  This was the main point of
  criticism that Bob Vanderbei mentioned.

* are <tt>!name!</tt> and <something> useful, as mentioned
  in <tt>rdoc-0.9.0acs1/README.local</tt> ?
