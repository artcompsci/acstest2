=Memo on the changes in acsdoc.rb

* I have changed the structure so that everything is in module
  Acsdoc. In this way, you can let rdoc to generate proper entries for
  methods.

* I added the new function, prep_rb, which cuts out code fragments
  between ":segment start: name" and ":segment end:". This function
  does minimal error check:

  * If the name of the segment file is the same as one of the
    currently opened files, print error and abort
  * If there are too many ":segment end:", print error and abort

* A rather tricky thing is that this program should be able to handle
  itself as input. This means, the strings like ":segment start:" in
  program string constant must be escaped. I did it in a rather nasty
  way, putting the following condition:

      if loc = s.index(":segment start:")  and s.index("\":segment start:\"")==nil

  As you can see, when ":segment start:" is found, the code checks if
  it is actually ":segment start:" (with double quotes) or not, and if
  that's the case, does not process that line.
