= Preface

This is a short introduction to ACSDOC, a document-processing system
which can generate latex or html files from a common, easy-to-write
text.

= Simple Example

:command: cd examples; ruby ../acsdoc.rb simpleexample.ok
:command: cd examples; ruby ../acsdoc.rb --tolatex simpleexample.ok
:command: cd examples; latex simpleexample
:command: cd examples; dvips -E -l 1 -x 1900 -o simpleexample.ps simpleexample
:command: cd examples; convert simpleexample.ps simpleexample.jpeg

The following is a simple example.

  :include: examples/simpleexample.ok

This one creates the output shown in figure ref(fig1)

:figure: examples/simpleexample.jpeg 8cm fig1
TeX output of simpleexample.ok

Here, what is shown is the LaTeX output created by

   acsdoc.rb --tolatex simplexample.ok
   latex simplexample.tex

You can also create an HTML page by

   acsdoc.rb simpleexample.ok

This command create a single HTML file, simpleexample.html, at the
same directory as the source .ok file lives.

<web>../examples/simpleexample.html|Here</web> is the created HTML
file.

= Installation and other requirements.

== Installing acsdoc

Acsdoc is provided as part of the ACS software system. It can be
installed as a stand-alone software. acsdoc.rb is a single Ruby
source program which require no other Ruby library files or
whatsoever. So you can just copy it to your preferred location.

Documents are all written in acsdoc format, and can be created by

   make documents

at the directory where the files are extracted from the archive.

We plan to offer some more "packaged" way to install the command and
documents.

== System requirements

Acsdoc has been tested on some distributions of Linux. It depends on
UNIX operating system, and uses following commands/softwares

* mv, rm, cp, cat, csh
* convert from ImageMagick
* latex, dvips
* latex "subsubsection" package

<tt>Dvips</tt> needs to understand options -E, -l, -x. If these
options are not available with your dvips, well, you need to modify
ascdoc.rb to supply appropriate options.

= Running acsdoc.

Syntax to invoke acsdoc is the following.

  % acsdoc.rb [options] [source files] infile ...

Here, <tt>[options]</tt> are command line options,  <tt>[source
files]</tt> are name of the program source file used in listing,
<tt>infile</tt> is the input text file.

In the following I'll describe the meaning of command line arguments.

== Input text file.

<tt>Infile</tt> is the input text file. Its format is described in
more details in chapter ref(sect:acsfunctionalities). One can supply
multiple input files in the case of the HTML generation. For Latex,
only one file can be used. The name of an input text file should end
with <tt>.ok</tt>.

== Source files.

<tt>Source files</tt> are the files used in including partial
codes. The use of them is described in sections
ref(sect:includefragments) and ref(sect:includefunctions). Currently,
files with extention <tt>.rb</tt> are recognized as Ruby source file,
<tt>.c</tt> C program,
<tt>.C</tt> and <tt>.cc</tt> C++ programs. Support on C/C++ programs
is rather primitive and might not serve your need.

== Options

:label: options

<tt> --directory dirname</tt>

This option makes the generate HTML file and additional image files
etc to be moved to directory +dirname+. Option argument +dirname+ must
exist. If directory  +dirname+  does not exist, it is created.

Note that this option is ignored if <tt>--tolatex</tt> option is
specified.


<tt> --keep-dot-files</tt>

This option is retained for backward compatibility. It has no effect.


<tt> --reuseoutput</tt>

This option controls if the output of inline commands (see section 
ref(sect:includecommand) for details) will be reused from previous run
of acsdoc. If this option is not specified, all commands are newly ran
on the fly. If this option is specified, and if the command appears in
the same line of the text input file in the same form, the output of
previous ran is reused.

<tt> --tolatex</tt>

Generate a Latex output instead of HTML. Default is HTML. If this
option is specified with multiple text input files, the result might
not correct. Latex mode is meant to be used with single input file.

If you want to process  multiple input files for generating single
Latex file, just create one input file by using +cat+. 

== Output files.

By default, one HTML file is created for each of one text input
file. If <tt>--tolatex</tt> option is specified, one Latex file is
created for one text input file, and you are not supposed to give
multiple input files.

There are quite a few other files generated. The image files will be
stored in <tt>.imgs</tt> directory. Thus, if you have multiple input
files which are processed separetely, <em>i.e.,</em> if you do

   % acsdoc.rb text1.ok
   % acsdoc.rb text2.ok

In one directory, The content of <tt>.imgs</tt> directory created in
the first command is overwritten by that of the second command. To
avoid this, use <tt>--directory</tt> option (see section
ref(sect:options) for more details) to put output files to
subdirectories.

Acsdoc also create a CSS file, <tt>.acsdoc-style.css</tt>, which is
referenced from HTML file. By default, the content of this CSS file is
the same for any output, but it would change when the version of
acsdoc.rb changes.

Finaly,  acsdoc creates a number of  fragment files from source files
specified in the command line. For example, for file <tt>foo.rb</tt>,
there will be a number of files with name starting with
<tt>.foo.rb</tt> (since the name of generated files start with a ".",
they do not appear when you do normal +ls+ without <tt>-a</tt>
option).


== Examples

 % acsdoc.rb introduction.ok

createss a single HTML file <tt>introduction.html</tt>. 

 % acsdoc.rb -d documents introduction.ok

creates a single HTML file <tt>introduction.html</tt> and store it to 
directory <tt>documents</tt>.

 % acsdoc.rb test.rb segmentsample.rb  introduction.ok
process the source files 
<tt>test.rb</tt> and <tt>segmentsample.rb</tt> to prepare fragment
files used in introduction.ok, and then creates an HTML file.

 % acsdoc.rb  introduction.ok sample.ok
creates two HTML files,  introduction.html sample,html, and add
navigation links to these HTML files. The section (or chapter) numbers
are as if these two HTML files are part of a single document.






= Tour over acsdoc funtionalities.

:label: acsfunctionalities

Markups in acsdoc is largely similar to that of Rdoc or RD, but not
exactly the same. Here we overview what is available with acsdoc.

== Sections.

One can start a new section (or subsection or chapter) by "="
(multiple "=" such as "==" or "===" result in deeper level, like 1.1
or 1.1.1)

The following is a sample for deep sections.

  :include: examples/sectionssample.ok

:command: cd examples; ruby ../acsdoc.rb sectionssample.ok
:command: cd examples; ruby ../acsdoc.rb --tolatex sectionssample.ok
:command: cd examples; latex sectionssample
:command: cd examples; dvips -E -l 1 -x 1900 -o sectionssample.ps sectionssample
:command: cd examples; convert sectionssample.ps sectionssample.jpeg

<web>examples/sectionssample.html|Here</web> is the created HTML
file.

Up to five levels are supported, at least with HTML document. Number
of levels available in  Latex document depends on what is available on
Latex. By default it is three.


== Itemized list

What you can do with

  <ul> or <ol>

in HTML, or \begin{itemize} or
\begin{enumerate} in Latex, you can do in a simpler way.

For example,

  Sample list
  * Item 1.
    More text for Item 1.
  * Item 2
    More on Item 2.

gives

---

Sample list
* Item 1.
  More text for Item 1.
* Item 2
  More on Item 2.

---

A nested list can be made in the following way

  Nested list
  * Item 1.
    More text for Item 1.
    * nested item 1
    * nested item 2
  * Item 2
    More on Item 2.

gives

---

Nested list
* Item 1.
  More text for Item 1.
  * nested item 1
  * nested item 2
* Item 2
  More on Item 2.

---

  Numbered list
  1. Item 1
  2. Item 2

gives:

Numbered list
1. Item 1
2. Item 2

Note that the identifier for numbered list is numnber + ".". The
number itself is not used in actual numberiing. Thus,

  Wrongly numbered list
  1. Item 1
  1. Item 2

gives 


Wrongly numbered list
1. Item 1
1. Item 2

== "as is" text

Text lines which start with a space, where this space is not followed
by *, -, or a number + ".", appear as is.

Example:

   This is as-is text

This can be used to show program list etc.

== Holizontal line

Three or more  "-" characters 

  ---

will be converted to

---

Note that it should start at first column. If any space is before "-",
it becomes "as is" text.

== Including file

  #:include: test.rb

(without <tt>"#"</tt>)  gives:

  :include: test.rb

Note that this is exeption for the as-is text, since this <tt>:include:</tt>
directive is interpreted even when it appears with preceeding space
characters. Also, space characters before the :include: directive are
added to each line of the included file. Thus

               #:include: test.rb

(without <tt>"#"</tt>) gives

               :include: test.rb

== Including program listing

You can use :inccode: in place of :include:. This may shows the
included text in slightly different way.

Include:

  :include: test.rb

Inccode:

  :inccode: test.rb
In HTML, currently there is no difference. In Latex, :inccode: gives
two horizontal lines marking the included code.


== Including  functions from source files

:label: includefunctions

For C/C++ or Ruby sources,  an automatic way to include one function
from source code is provided. In Ruby, to include the listing of
function buz fom class (or module)  Bar in file foo.rb, you can write

  ##  :include: .foo.rb+buz+Bar

For exaple, <tt>":include: .acsdoc.rb+wordmarkup+Acsdoc"</tt> gives

 :include: .acsdoc.rb+wordmarkup+Acsdoc

If +buz+ is the only function with that name in that file, or if buz is
the top-level function, you can omit the class name as

  ##  :include: .foo.rb+buz

The names of source files should be given to acsdoc.rb as command-line
arguments. They should appear before real .ok files in the argument
list.

== Including code flagments.

:label: includefragments


It is also possible to inclde a specified region from a source file.
The region is (in the source file foo.rb) marked by <tt>"# :segment start: bar"</tt>
and <tt>"# :segment end: bar"</tt> (here, bar can be some arbitrary name,
without space or other special characters), and is included by

 ## :include: .foo.rb-bar

For example, if the source file  segmentsample.rb is the following:

 :include: segmentsample.rb

By

  #  :include: .segmentsample.rb-body

We can get the following:

  :include: .segmentsample.rb-body

== Including the output of some program

:label: includecommand

There are followng five directives to run commands

* :output: 
* :command: 
* :commandoutput:
* :commandinput:
* :commandinputoutput:

and one additional directive

* :prompt:


Directive  :output: echo foo

gives

 :output: echo foo

Directive  :commandoutput: setenv LANG C ; date
 
 :commandoutput: setenv LANG C ; date

Directive  :command: echo test

gives nothint as output, but it is stull executed. Thus, it can be
used to do whatever things you like.

 :command: echo test

Directive :commandoutput: echo test gives

 :commandoutput: echo test

Directive  :commandinput: cat > aho END
requires actual input data followed by "END", like

 #  :commandinput: cat > aho END
 #aaa
 #bbb
 #ccc
 #END

Running this (without #) shows the input and in this case create a file "aho"

  :commandinput: cat > aho END
aaa
bbb
ccc
END

You can check if the file "aho" is made by:

 #  :commandoutput: ls -al aho; pwd
 #  :commandoutput: cat aho
 # :command: rm aho

The result is:

  :commandoutput: ls -al aho; pwd
  :commandoutput: cat aho
  :command: rm aho

Directive  :commandinputoutput: cat END is similar to :commandinput:,
but shows the result in text.

 # :commandinputoutput: cat END
 # aaa
 # bbb
 # ccc
 # END

This (without #) gives you
  :commandinputoutput: cat END
aaa
bbb
ccc
END

Finally, :prompt: xxx> changes the prompt to "xxx>".

Thus, 

 # :prompt: yebisu>
 # :commandoutput: echo test

gives

 :prompt: yebisu>
 :commandoutput: echo test

== Boldface, italic, and typewriter font

<b>Boldface</b>, <em>italic</em>, and <tt>typewriter font</tt> are
available. This part is generated from:

  <b>Boldface</b>, <em>italic</em>, and <tt>typewriter font</tt>

For single word (without no space), you can use a more compact form

  Sample *boldface*, _italic_, and +typewriter+ fonts.

which will look like:

Sample *Boldface*, _italic_, and +typewriter+ fonts.

These markups (probably) do not work within listing. It should work
with itemized list.

* *boldface* in an item.

== Inline tex code.

Any tex code fragment can be embedded using the following form

   \<tex> tex codes </tex>

It can span to multiple lines. For example,

   Here, \<tex>$a= b$</tex> is a sample inline tex code.

gives

Here, <tex>$a= b$</tex> is a sample inline tex code.

Since the use of tex codes is mostly to embed math formulae, one can
write

   <$ tex codes$>
instead of

   \<tex>$ tex codes $</tex>

Thus,

   Here, <$a= b$> is a sample inline tex code.

gives

Here, <$a= b$> is a sample inline tex code.



== Numbered equations

The following form:

 #  :equation:
 # \label{equationlabel}
 # a=b.

(without "#") gives 

:equation:
\label{equationlabel}
a=b.

The texts after :equation: directive (untill a blanck line) will be
processed in Latex equation environment. Equation numbers are
maintained within acsdoc. Anything which can be written in Latex
equation environment can be used. To refer to the above equation, you
can write

   equation ref(equation label)
which gives "equation ref(equationlabel)." The label cannot contain
space.

Latex eqnarray environment can be used as

 # :eqnarray:
 # \label{arrayeq}
 # a &=& b,\nonumber\\
 # c &=&d.

:eqnarray:
\label{arrayeq}
a &=& b,\nonumber\\
c &=&d.

Note that the equation number counter of acsdoc assumes that only one
number is used even when eqnarray is used. Thus, if you do

 # :eqnarray:
 # \label{arrayeq}
 # a &=& b,\\
 # c &=&d.

You get:


:eqnarray:
\label{arrayeq}
a &=& b,\\
c &=&d.

However, the next equation will have wrong number like:

:equation:
\label{testeq}
E=mc^2.

== Figures

As in latex, one can make numbered figures. The syntax is

 # :figure: sample.gif 5cm acslogo
 # The ACS logo

Which gives figure ref(acslogo).

:figure: sample.gif 5cm acslogo
The ACS logo

Here, <em>sample.gif</em> is the name of the image file, which can have any
format which is understood by "convert" command of ImageMagick. _5cm_
is the horizontal size of the image (meaningful in Latex conversion
only), and _acslogo_ is the label. The text in the next and following
lines, untill a blank line appear, become the figure caption.
Thus, this figure can be refereed to by

      Figure ref (acslogo)
(without space between ref and (acslogo)). 
Here is reference to this figure: figure ref(acslogo).

== More on references

:label: moreonreferences

A section (or chapter) can be labeled by the :label: directive as

  #  :label: label

For examle, this section is labeled as

 # :label: moreonreferences

And can be referenced as

 # Section ref (sect:moreonreferences) is this section.

Here is the output:

Section ref(sect:moreonreferences) is this section.

== Multiple input files

When acsdoc is applied to multiple input (.ok) files, multiple HTML
files (one for one .ok file) is created, but each file will have
navigation links to "previous" and "next" files. The order of the
files is simply the order given in the command line argument.

The navigation link has "Up" entry, which by default does not point to
an URL. It can be specified by setting a value in the initialization
file as

  @@toppagefilename= "some_file_name"
For example,

  @@toppagefilename= "../index.html"
would point to <tt>index.html</tt> in the parent directory.


== Table of contents

The :tableofcontents: directive creates the table of contents. Example:

 # :tableofcontents:
It should appear as only word in one line.

== Links to external URLs.

One can use \<web\> tag to make links to external URL. For example,

 \<web>http://www.artcompsci.org|ACS homepage</web>
creates a link:  <web>http://www.artcompsci.org|ACS homepage</web>.

== Inline image

If you want to have an inline image, you can use the form

  link: image_file
(without space after ":"). For example,
  link: sample.gif
gives
link:sample.gif

Note that "link: ..." should appear as single line without other
words.

Note that here the link is a direct link to the image file. Thus, if
you move the generated HTML file by "--directory" option or by hand,
you need to guarantee that image files are in the correct location.

== Comments.

Lines starting with <tt>#</tt> in the first colums are treated as
comments and not further processed.

# Sample comments (not shown in the processed documents)

== Examples.

All of the functionalities described in this document is used in this
document. So the best place to look at examples is the
<web>../introduction.ok|input  file itself</web>.


= Initialization file

Initialization file is searched in the order of $ACSDOCINITRC,
./.acsdocinitrc, and ~/.acsdocinitrc. The things you can write in the
initialization file is Ruby statement. A typical way to use is
something like:

   # acsdoc initialization file
   print "Loading the initialization file for ascdoc\n"
   @@addtional_preambles_for_inline_tex = "\\usepackage{epsf}"
   @@addtional_commands_for_inline_tex = "\\input macros"
This one allows the use of epsf package (style file), and macros.tex
is included after \begin{document}.


= Wish lists

* citations
* tables



= Tips

== Change the document class for Latex

To change the document class, supply appropriate value to variables
<tt>@@basic_preambles_for_tex</tt> and <tt>@@headers</tt>  in the initialization file
(.acsdocinitrc). For example,

  @@basic_preambles_for_tex = <<END
  \\documentclass{article}
  \\usepackage{graphicx}
  END
  @@header=[
  "chapter","section","subsection","subsubsection",
  "subsubsubsection", "subsubsubsubsection"]

is appropriate for article class. First item of <tt>@@header</tt> is
not used. Default is "book" class.


= Known problems

== tags in listing mode

Most tags show themselves up correctly in listing (lines with
preceeding space) mode, but

 \<tex>
and
 \<web>
are two exeptions, at
least with current (as of Nov 21 2005) version of acsdoc.rb. You need
to type
 \\<tex>
or
 \\<web>
even in listing mode.



= Sandbox

Hmm,  $, ?, _ ...

Are, does blank line still work as new paragraph?

This should be a new paragraph.

This also.


   This is as-is text with some tags <xxx>, <tt>, <b>, \begin{xxx}

Hmm.
