README for the language section of ACS

Piet Hut and Jun Makino

In this directory, "lan", there are many subdirectories, each
containing translations into different languages of the main
ACS html pages.  If you like to help us translate these pages
in a language not yet covered, we would greatly appreciate that.

All you have to do is copy the pages that you can find here under
"lan/english", and translate them in the new language.  These pages
are almost the same as the html pages at the top level of ACS, the
difference being that they contain the extra part in the path name
that is needed to get back to the top level of the ACS directory tree,
while starting on the "lan/some_language" level.

Please send us an email message, to "piet ATSIGN ias.edu", if you
have translated some part of these html files, so that we can add your
pages here.  Also, if you are interested to translate some part of
the main text, we will be very glad to discuss with you what the best
approach would be.

Thank you!
