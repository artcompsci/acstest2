round off, but in case of half-way, round up.

Let Bob and Alice bicker about that.

With

r(m) \, = \, \left(m^{-2/3}-1\right)^{-1/2}
$$</tex>

we have

<tex>$$
r(1/4) \, = \, \left(2^{4/3}-1\right)^{-1/2} \approx 0.8111
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
r(1/2) \, = \, \left(2^{2/3}-1\right)^{-1/2} \approx 1.305
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
r(3/4) \, = \, \left(2^{4/3}3^{-2/3}-1\right)^{-1/2} \approx 2.175
$$</tex>

mkplummer wrong?
Hmm, but how can energy be so correct then?
Aha, quartiles: forget sqrt.
Now with quartiles1.rb:

 :commandoutput: ruby mkplummer2.rb -n 10000 | ruby quartiles.rb

 :commandoutput: ruby mkplummer2.rb -n 10000 | ruby quartiles.rb

 :commandoutput: ruby mkplummer2.rb -n 10000 | ruby quartiles.rb

*Alice*: Still, we could have made the same mistake in coding and testing,
converting <tex>$m(r)$</tex> to <tex>$r(m)$</tex>.  Let us do one final
explicit check.  We have

<tex>$$
m(r) \, = \, \left(1 + r^{-2}\right)^{-3/2}
$$</tex>

So this means:

<tex>$$
m(r(1/4)) \, = \, \left(1+ 2^{4/3} - 1\right)^{-3/2} \, = \, 2^{-2} \, = \, 1/4
$$</tex>

Similarly with the half-mass radius <tex>$m(r(1/2)) = 1/2$</tex>, and:

<tex>$$
m(r(3/4)) \, = \, \left(1+ 3^{-2/3}2^{4/3} - 1\right)^{-3/2} \, = \, 
  3.2^{-2} \, = \, 3/4
$$</tex>





= Standard Units

== Confusion

*Bob*: One thing students always have great trouble with is scaling the
results from an N-body simulation back to physical quantities, expressed
in physical or astrophysical units.

*Alice*: That is not surprising.  And I must say, I often have to think
careful about such questions.  It may be trivial, from a scientific point
of view, but in practice, it is easy to make a mistake.  It is one thing
to get as an answer that your starcluster retains a final mass of
<tt>0.765</tt> at the end of a run, but it is quite another to translate
that into grams, or into solar masses.

*Bob*: At least the physical units are standardized.  Mass comes in grams,
or in kilograms.  It is annoying that there are still two sets of
units in general use in astrophysics, _MKS_ and _cgs_, but at least
the conversation between those two is relatively straightforward, just
a factor of a thousand in the case of masses.  And similarly, astrophysical
units are standardized: mass general comes in units of a solar mass.
But in computer simulations, everybody is using whatever convention
they like.  I find it often difficult to interpret the results that
come from running someone else's code.  Not everybody clearly
documents what the units is they have been using.

*Alice*: But there _is_ a standard for computer simulations in stellar
dynamics.  And I have been using that standard ever since I started running
simulations.

*Bob*: What are they called?

*Alice*: Hmm.  They are generally refered to as `standard units.'  Perhaps
that is one reason that they haven't found general acceptance yet.  Maybe
we should give them a real name!  They are sometimes refered to as `Heggie
units,' since Douglas Heggie was the first one, as far as I know, to stress
the need for such standardization.  

*Bob*: Did he publish the definition of his standards?

*Alice*: Yes, in a paper with Bob Mathieu, back in 1986, as a contribution
to a conference where this issue of standardization was discussed.
The reference is <i>xxx xxx xxx</i>, by Douglas Heggie and Robert Mathieu,
and it appeared in 1986, on page 233 in <i>The Use of Supercomputers
in Stellar Dynamics</i>, edited by Steve McMillan and Piet Hut, and
published by Springer.

*Bob*: How did they define their units?

*Alice*: They took the gravitational constant and total mass of a star
cluster to be unity, and they took the total energy to be -1/4.

*Bob*: Why one quarter?  Unlike the first two choices, that doesn't sound
very natural to me.  Why not unity?

*Alice*: Actually, the origin of their definition stems from the fact that
they took the virial radius <tex>$r_V$</tex> to be unity.  I should have
introduced their choice as:

:equation:
G \, = \, M \, = \, r_V \, = \, 1

The fact that <tex>$E_{tot}=-0.25$</tex> is a consequence from this fact.

*Bob*: I know the virial _theorem_, but what is a virial _radius_?

*Alice*: For an equal mass system, an elegant definition is: the virial
radius is the inverse of the average inverse distance between particles
in an N-body system.  Expressed as a formula:

:equation:
{1\over r_V} \, = \, \left<{1\over |\br_i -\br_j|}\right>_{i\neq j}

avaraged over all particle pairs <tex>$i, j$</tex>.  For a general system
of particles with masses <tex>$m_i$</tex> and total mass _M_, the definition
is:

:equation:
{M\over r_V} \, = \, \sum_i\sum_{j\atop j\neq i}{m_im_j\over |\br_i -\br_j|}

and of course, we recognize that this is the potential energy of an N-body
system, for <tex>$G=1$</tex>, apart for a factor of two, because we
have now counted every pair twice.  So we can write the potential energy of
an N-body system as:

:equation:
E_{pot} \, = \, -\,G\sum_{i<j}{m_im_j\over |\br_i -\br_j|}
  \, = \, - \, \half {GM\over r_V}

*Bob*: and now we can use the virial theorem, which tells us that
the magnitude of the total energy is half that of the potential energy,
to write:

:equation:
E_{tot} \, = \, -\half E_{pot} \, =\, -\, {1 \over 4}{GM\over r_V}

and with our previous choice of <tex>$G=M=1$</tex>, we get:

:equation:
E_{tot} \, = \, -\, {1 \over 4}{1\over r_V}

Now I see what you meant, with the total energy of -1/4 being a consequence
the choice of <tex>$G=M=r_V=1$</tex>.  But I'm still puzzled.  What is
so special about the virial radius that you want to set it equal to unity?
Why not set the total energy equal to unity, say?

*Alice*: I think that the original idea was that we would like to choose the
most natural units for the three basic physical units, namely those of mass,
length, and time.  But since we also like to scale the gravitational constant
to unity, we have only two degrees of freedom left over.  The total mass is
an obvious candidate, since it appears in many equations as <tex>$GM$</tex>,
which is nice to forget about by equating it to <tex>$1$</tex>.  It
also means that for equal-mass N-body systems, you can count on each particle
always having a mass of <tex>$1/N$</tex>.

The only remaining question is: what to do with the last degree of freedom.
Do you want to find a natural length scale or a natural time scale, or do
you want to take a more derived quantity, not directly coupled to the basic
physical units, such as the energy?  I for one agree with Heggie and Mathieu
that it is more elegant to choose a basic physical quantity, either a length
or time scale.

*Bob*: I think I would prefer total energy, derived or not.  But if you insist
on purity, well, a natural length scale for a star cluster is the half-mass
radius <tex>$r_h$</tex>.  And a natural time scale in turn is the
crossing time <tex>$t_h$</tex> at the half-mass radius, the typical
time for a particle to cross the system, starting at the half-mass radius.

*Alice*: It is already clear from your suggestion that choosing a length
scale is somewhat more natural than choosing a time scale, since in
your time scale definition you make use of an earlier length scale definition.

*Bob*: So what is wrong with the choice of <tex>$G=M=r_h=1$</tex>?

*Alice*: There is nothing wrong with that, and people have used that choice
as well.  The problem is that in that case the total energy has a non-obvious
value, typically somewhere like 
<tex>$E_{tot}=0.2$</tex>, but not exactly.

*Bob*: Well, my original suggestion was to make <tex>$E_{tot}=1$</tex>.
Not only is that an exact number, it is a very simple number.  I'm
still not sure what is wrong with that.

*Alice*: If you choose the total energy to be one, your half-mass radius
comes out to be very small, about 1/5, and that is not a very natural value.

*Bob*: Hmm, yes, it would be a bit of a nuisance, to deal with a core radius
of <tex>$r_c=0.02$</tex>, say, and then having to remember that we are dealing
with a not very concentrated cluster, since <tex>$r_h=0.2$</tex> and therefore
<tex>$r_c/r_h=0.1$</tex>.

*Alice*: To sum up, we really would like to have a system of length units,
in which the half-mass radius is close to unity.  However, the
half-mass radius is not a conserved quantity, and as soon as you start
a simulation, the half-mass radius may change.  Therefore, it is better
to take a conserved quantity, such as the total energy, as a gauge,
and to give it a simple value in such a way that it implies that the
unit of length is at least close to the half-mass radius.  This must
have been the sort of thinking that went into the definition of the
standard units, I'm pretty sure.

*Bob*: That all makes sense.  But in practice, the half-mass radius does
not change much, if you simulate a star cluster.  Only after core collapse
does the half-mass radius begin to expand.

*Alice*: You are used to dealing with a system that starts in dynamic
equilibrium.  However, if you start with a cold collapse, or a system
that has too much kinetic energy and starts off expanding, in both cases
the half-mass radius will change right away, while the total energy will
remain conserved.

*Bob*: Okay, I see the advantages of the standard units.  And since I don't
feel very strong about my other two candidates for standardization,
I'm happy to use those virial units, what did you call them, Heggie units?

*Alice*: Yes, were it not for the fact that Douglas Heggie is a modest
gentleman, who would be the first to point out that those units have been
used by others before he suggested them.  Virial units might actually be
a reasonable name; I haven't heard that expression yet.

*Bob*: Hmmm.  It just slipped out, but to me it sounds too much like a
medical term, reminding me of a virus.  And I certainly don't like computer
viruses.  I prefer the term Heggie units: he should get credit for his
suggestion.

*Alice*: We'll see what the field decides.

*Bob*: By the way, I was impressed by the fact that you juggled those numbers
so easily, like that value 0.2 that you pulled out of a hat.  What was that
again?

*Alice*: That was the value for the half-mass radius, if you would insist on a
total mass of unity.

*Bob*: Ah yes, did you make that up to impress me, or did you calculate or
guestimate that quickly?

*Alice*: None of the above.  Since I have been working with these standard
units for a long time, and especially since I have been teaching it to my
students, some of these numbers just stick in my mind.  You mentioned from
the start that students always have problems with scaling, and my students
are no exception.

*Bob*: I guess the counter-intuitive aspect is that if your ruler shrinks,
everything you measure becomes bigger, and similarly, if you take a ruler
with larger units of length, the whole world gets smaller, in terms of the
values you read off.  Knowing where to multiply and where to divide is
something that requires some thought.  With one ruler changing, you have
to be careful, and if you simultaneously change your ruler, your clock,
and your scales, changing your units of length, time, and mass, it is real
easy to go wrong.

*Alice*: I know from experience!  And still I always have to double check.

*Bob*: Glad to hear we share the same problem.  And just to make sure that
I can buy into your story, scaring me away with having to handle tiny values
for the half-mass radius, shall we quickly check with Plummer's model as a
concrete application how you can derive the numbers you mentioned?

*Alice*: Good idea!  It never hurts to check, as we've seen now already a
number of times.  But I don't like working with factors like
<tex>$3\pi/16$</tex> and <tex>$(2^{2/3}-1)^{-1/2}$</tex>.  Let's make
some simplications, trying to use only fractions like <tex>$1/3$</tex>
and <tex>$1/4$</tex> and the like, but let's not get more accurate.  That
should be enough to show our main point.

So let us start with the original expressions for the total energy
<tex>$E_{tot}$</tex> which we may as well abbreviate as <tex>$E$</tex>,
the half-mass radius <tex>$r_h$</tex> and the virial radius <tex>$r_V$</tex>,
given in terms of the structural length <tex>$a$</tex>.  Remember that
<tex>$a$</tex> was what we first encountered as the softening length, when
we smoothed the potential of point particles.  In analogy, we started of 
with our Plummer potential

:equation:
U(r) \, = \, -\,GM {1\over \,\left(r^2 + a^2\right)^{1/2}}

And in terms of <tex>$a$</tex>, we can write, with <tex>$G=M=1$</tex>:

:equation:
E \, = \, -\, {3\pi\over64}{1\over a} \, \approx \,
   {1\over 10}\times{3\over 2}{1\over a}

:equation:
r_h \, = \, \left(2^{2/3}-1\right)^{-1/2} a  \, \approx \, {4\over 3} a

:equation:
r_V \, = \, {16 \over 3\pi} a  \, \approx \, {5\over 3} a

I have split off the factor <tex>$1/10$</tex> in the expression for
the energy, so that we can deal with remaining numbers that are all of
order unity, in the form of fractions of small integers.

All we have to do now is to choose different values for <tex>$a$</tex>.
For each choice of <tex>$a$</tex>, we can see explicitly how everything
else will receive different values.  The structural length <tex>$a$</tex>
plays the role of our ruler.

*Bob*: That is a nice way to lay it all out.  Okay, so we have talked about
three choices of units, based on what we choose to set equal to one: the
energy, the half-mass radius, and the virial radius.  Let us start
with the energy

*Alice*: If we take <tex>$E=1$</tex>, we are forced to take <tex>$a=3/20$</tex>
which implies <tex>$r_h=1/5$</tex> and <tex>$r_V=1/4$</tex>.

*Bob*: How simple!  Yes, it is clear now, and you were right about that value
of roughly <tex>$0.2$</tex> for the half-mass radius.  I'm curious to
see what the other two choices will lead to.  Let us make a list:

:equation:
E = -1 \Rightarrow r_h \approx 1/5 , r_V = 1/4

:equation:
r_h = 1 \Rightarrow E \approx -1/5 , r_V \approx 5/4

:equation:
r_V = 1 \Rightarrow E = -1/4 , r_h \approx 4/5

*Alice*: Yes, that is a good summary, and it important to indicate which
relations are approximate and which are exact because the follow from the
definitions.

*Bob*: And these are useful numbers to remember.  Actually, now that we
have decided to adopt the `standard units' as standard units (we have
to come up with a better name), it is only the bottom line that is
really worth remembering.

*Alice*: And since <tex>$E=-1/4$</tex> for all models in the standard units,
for Plummer's model there is only one number to remember: the fact
that the half-mass radius is roughly <tex>$4/5$</tex>.

*Bob*: Ah, but there is also the structural length.  Let's see, in standard
units that is roughly <tex>$3/5$</tex>.  That is a second useful number to
remember, since it gives a measure for the size of the core of the potential.
So we have:

:equation:
r_V : r_h : a  \approx 5 : 4 : 3

And this shows that Plummer's model is not very centrally condensed:
the core is barely smaller than the half-mass radius.

*Alice*: We can define a core radius more exactly.  The standard definition
for observers is to require the projected mass density
<tex>$\Sigma$</tex> to drop by a factor of two.  Since

:equation:
\Sigma = {M\over\pi a^2}\left(1+{d^2\over a^2}\right)^{-2}

this gives for the core radius <tex>$r_c$</tex> the value

:equation:
r_c = {a\over\sqrt{2}}

*Bob*: And that gives us a third number to remember for Plummer's model:

:equation:
r_V : r_h : a : r_c \approx 5 : 4 : 3 : 2

*Alice*: I like that!  An unlikely simple progression.  I thought I knew
Plummer's model by now, but I had not realized how simple the ratios for
these main numbers are.  Okay, let's remember them all!

*Bob*: Or, to be a bit more lazy, I may just remember that the half-mass
radius is twice as large as the core radius, that the structural radius
lies about half-way in between, and that the virial radius is a bit larger
than the half-mass radius.

:equation:
E_{pot} = -{3\pi\over32}{GM^2\over a}

Standard Units:

:equation:
E_{pot} = -{3\pi\over32}{1\over a} = -{1 \over 2} \Rightarrow

:equation:
a = {3\pi\over16}

We had:

In standard units:
