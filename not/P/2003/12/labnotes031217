2003, December 17, Wednesday, Kyoto: Jun, Piet

1. SWIG interface Ruby - C

We struggled with C++ and we gave up for now.  Jun got something to
work on his machine, with the gcc compiler, version 2.95.3.  Piet then
recompiled the latest ruby 1.6 using his gcc compiler, version 3.2.1,
and there we got error messages.

2. Handcoded interface Ruby - C

Jun managed to write a handcoded interface, in <tt>pairwize.c</tt>.
Here is the timing, the ratio of the execution time for N particles in
cold collapse, between this handcoded C-calling version and the original
nbody_sh1.C version:

 N = 2  :  72
 N = 3  :  69
 N = 10 :  40
 N = 20 :  28
 N = 50 :  21
 N = 100:  19
 N = 200:  19
