= Sprinkling Particles in Space

== Choosing a Distance

*Alice*: Now I understand what your code is doing, except for a few crucial
lines.  First there is the one-liner about choosing the distance
between a new star and the center of the star cluster:

 :include: .mkplummer1.rb-4

Can you tell me what this expression means, and how it is derived?
It must somehow be related to the density distribution
<tex>$\rho(r)$</tex>, which you have already derived from the potential.
How exactly do Aarseth, Henon and Wielen use the density for particle
sprinkling?

*Bob*: They describe their technique in a few words, and I had to read
those words carefully, and do some head scratching, to figure out what
it meant.  But as always, once you see it, it is really easy.  Let me
try to summarize it in my own words.

First we introduce the cumulative mass distribution

:equation:
\label{mrsymb}
m(r) \, = \, \int_0^r 4 \pi r^2 \rho(r) dr

which is the amount of mass that is included within the star cluster
inside a distance <tex>$r$</tex> from the center.  When we create a
new star, and place it at radius <tex>$r$</tex>, that star will have
<tex>$m(r)$</tex> of the mass of the cluster at positions closer to
the center, and <tex>$M-m(r)$</tex> of the mass at positions further
from the center.

In other words, it will see a fraction <tex>$m(r)/M$</tex> of the
total mass inside its radial position.  Now that fraction could be
anything between 0 and 1.  It will be 0 if the particle is placed
exactly in the center, and it will approach 1 if the particle is
placed very far away, reaching 1 when the particle is placed at
infinity.

The ranking of each particle, in terms of the enclosed mass, is random
and uniform in the mass fraction.  In other words, <tex>$m(r)/M$</tex>
will be a random value between 0 and 1, with each value equally likely.

So here is the idea: spin a random number generator in order to obtain
a a random number <tex>$m_i$</tex>, with <tex>$0 \le m_i \le M$</tex>,
and we consider that to be the fractional mass contained within the
radius <tex>$r_i$</tex> of particle <tex>$i$</tex>.  So all we know is
that <tex>$m(r_i)=m_i$</tex>, but what we need to know is
<tex>$r_i$</tex> itself.  So the procedure is to invert (ref(mrsymb))
to obtain a function <tex>$r(m)$</tex>, and then life is simple:
<tex>$r_i=r(m_i)$</tex>.

== Following the Recipe

*Alice*: That sounds straightforward.  Can you show me the expressions
you found for <tex>$m(r)$</tex> and <tex>$r(m)$</tex>?

*Bob*: I simply took their expressions.  They use a system of units in which
the total mass _M_, the gravitational constant _G_ and the structural length
scale _a_ that we used above are all unity.  The mass enclosed within
a radius _r_ then becomes:

:equation:
\label{mrahw}
m(r) \, = \, r^3\left(r^2 + 1\right)^{-3/2}

and the radius that corresponds to a mass fraction becomes:

:equation:
\label{rmahw}
r(m) \, = \, \left(m^{-2/3}-1\right)^{-1/2}

As you can see in the second line of the inner loop in my +mkplummer+
method, this is how I determine the radial position of each particle,
using Ruby's random number generator +rand+:

 :include: .mkplummer1.rb-4

*Alice*: Hmm.  You didn't check whether they had done their math
correctly?

*Bob*: No need to.  This is a paper by Aarseth, Henon, Wielen.
Besides, it is thirty years old and has been cited zillions of times
by others.  I'm sure this is a result that can be trusted.

*Alice*: I don't like to accept things on trust, no matter what the
authority may be behind it.  Not that I expect them to be wrong,
I agree that that would be highly improbable.  Still, I would feel
much better to derive the results ourselves.  Besides, if we work
it out now, we can both use those notes when we have to teach it in
class to the student.  Better still, we just put it into the material
we preper for them on the web.

*Bob*: Okay, if you like.  Your turn, though, I already derived the
density.  Do you want to use a package from symbolic integration?
Differentation is easy enough by hand, but I must admit, I'm a bit
rusty in my integration.

== Cumulative Mass
 
*Alice*: So am I, and that is exactly a reason to do it with pen and
paper, tempting as it is to use a symbolic package.  Okay.  I'll start
with the density you derived:

:equation:
\rho(r) \, = \, {M \over 4\pi } {3a^2 \over \,\left(r^2 + a^2\right)^{5/2}}

By definition, this gives us for the cumulative mass, as a function of radius:

:eqnarray:
m(r) \, &=& \, \int_0^r 4 \pi r^2 \rho(r) dr                       \nonumber\\
  &=& \, 
\int_0^r {3M\over a^3}r^2\left(1+{r^2\over a^2}\right)^{-5/2}dr

The variable <tex>$r$</tex> appears in the integrand only in terms of
the combination <tex>$r^2/a^2$</tex>, so a natural change of variables is:

<tex>$$
x = {r^2\over a^2} \,\,\,\,\,\, \Rightarrow\,\,\,\,\,\, 
r = a\sqrt{x} \,\,\,\,\,\, \Rightarrow \,\,\,\,\,\, 
dr = {a\over2}\,{dx\over\sqrt{x}} \,\,\,\,\,\, \Rightarrow 
$$</tex>

which gives us:

:eqnarray:
m(r) \, &=& \, {3M\over a^3}
\int_0^{r^2/a^2} (a^2x)(1+x)^{-5/2}{a\over2}\,{dx\over\sqrt{x}}     \nonumber\\
&=& \, {3M\over 2}
\int_0^{r^2/a^2} x^{1/2}(1+x)^{-5/2}dx                              \nonumber

It is easier to bring the total mass to the other side, as an expression
for the fractional cumulative mass.  I don't like the high power
$</tex>5/2$</tex> in the integrand.  I'll use integration by parts to
lower the power:

:eqnarray:
{m(r)\over M} \, &=& \, 
-\int_0^{r^2/a^2} x^{1/2}{d\over dx}\left\{(1+x)^{-3/2}\right\}dx  \nonumber\\
\, &=& \, -\int_0^{r^2/a^2} d\left\{x^{1/2}(1+x)^{-3/2}\right\}
\,+\half\int_0^{r^2/a^2}(1+x)^{-3/2}
{d\over dx}\left\{x^{1/2}\right\}dx                             \nonumber\\
&=& \, -\left. x^{1/2}(1+x)^{-3/2}\right|_0^{r^2/a^2}
\quad\quad\quad+\half\int_0^{r^2/a^2} x^{-1/2}(1+x)^{-3/2}dx         \nonumber

That looks a bit better already.  How about another change of variables:

<tex>$$
y = {1\over x} \,\,\,\,\,\, \Rightarrow\,\,\,\,\,\, 
x = {1\over y} \,\,\,\,\,\, \Rightarrow \,\,\,\,\,\,
dx = -{1\over y^2}\,dy \,\,\,\,\,\, \Rightarrow 
$$</tex>

This gives us:

:eqnarray:
{m(r)\over M} \, &=& \, 
-{r \over a}\left(1+{r^2\over a^2}\right)^{-3/2}\quad\quad\quad\,\,\,
+\half\int_\infty^{a^2/r^2} y^{1/2}\left(1+{1\over y}\right)^{-3/2}
\left\{-{1\over y^2}\,dy\right\}                                   \nonumber\\
 &=& \, 
-{r \over a}\left(1+{r^2\over a^2}\right)^{-3/2}\quad\quad\quad\,\,\,
-\half\int_\infty^{a^2/r^2} y^{-3/2}\left(1+{1\over y}\right)^{-3/2}dy   \nonumber\\
 &=& \, 
-{r \over a}\left({r^2\over a^2}\left({a^2\over r^2}
+1\right)\right)^{-3/2}\,\,\,
-\half\int_\infty^{a^2/r^2} (y+1)^{-3/2}dy   \nonumber\\
 &=& \, 
-{r \over a}\,\left({r \over a}\right)^{-3}
\left({a^2\over r^2}+1\right)^{-3/2}\,
+\left. (y+1)^{-1/2}\right|_\infty^{a^2/r^2}   \nonumber\\
 &=& \, 
-{a^2 \over r^2}\left(1+{a^2\over r^2}\right)^{-3/2}\quad\quad\quad
+\left(1+{a^2\over r^2}\right)^{-1/2}            \nonumber\\
 &=& \, \quad\quad\,\,
\left(1+{a^2\over r^2}\right)^{-3/2}\left\{-{a^2 \over r^2}
+\left(1+{a^2\over r^2}\right)\right\}                    \nonumber\\
 &=& \, \quad\quad\,\,
\left(1+{a^2\over r^2}\right)^{-3/2}

So here is what we were looking for:

:equation:
m(r) \, = \, M\left(1+{a^2\over r^2}\right)^{-3/2}

Indeed eq. (ref(mrahw)), with their choice of units.

== Physical Intuition

*Bob*: Well, if you are rusty in your integrations, then I don't know what
to call myself.  Nice job!  It is always surprising to me how the result
of that type of calculation can come out in such a simple form.

*Alice*: There probably is a good physical reason for it to be this simple.
Let's think.  I started with density, something that you had found by
differentiation, and then I integrated the product of the density and
the geometric opening angle factor of <tex>$4\pi r^2$</tex>.  Apart from
that factor, integration and differentiation would have cancelled.  Pity.

*Bob*: Hey, wait a minute.  I found the density by integrating alright, but
in the following way, using Poisson's equation:

:equation:
{1\over r^2}{d\over dr}\left( r^2{d\over dr}\Phi(r)\right) \,=\, 4\pi G\rho(r)

Doesn't that have exactly the factor <tex>$r^2$</tex> you were looking for?

*Alice*: It does . . .  Hey, I could have started there!  I could have written:

:eqnarray:
m(r) \, &=& \, \int_0^r 4 \pi r^2 \rho(r) dr                       \nonumber\\
  &=& \, 
{1\over G}\,
\int_0^r {d\over dr}\left( r^2{d\over dr}\Phi(r)\right)            \nonumber\\
  &=& \, 
{1\over G}\,
\left. {d\over dr}\left( r^2{d\over dr}\Phi(r)\right)\right|_0^r    \nonumber\\
  &=& \, 
{1\over G}\, r^2{d\Phi \over dr}                                    \nonumber

*Bob*: Ah, I remember telling you that it might come in handy to have the
derivatives of the potential at hand.

*Alice*: Not only that, here is the physical meaning we were looking for!
You also mentioned that the gradient of the potential is the gravitational
force, apart from a minus sign.  So what this equation is telling us, is
simply that the physical force is proportional to mass and inverse
proportional to the radius squared: Newton's gravity!  We could have
started that way.  The magnitude of the force on a particle with mass
<tex>$m_p$</tex> at distance <tex>$r$</tex> from the center is of course:

<tex>$$
F \, = \, G \, {m_p m(r) \over r^2}
$$</tex>

and also equal to:

<tex>$$
F \, = \, \left|-\,m_p\,{d\Phi \over dr}\right| \, = \, m_p\,{d\Phi \over dr}
$$</tex>

since <tex>$d\Phi/dr\ge0$</tex> everywhere.

*Bob*: You're right.  If we would have started with those two lines, we
could have written

<tex>$$
m(r) \, = \, {1\over G}\, r^2{d\Phi \over dr}
$$</tex>

right away.  And with the expression I wrote down yesterday,

<tex>$$
\frac{d}{dr}\Phi(r) \,= \, GM {r \over \,\left(r^2 + a^2\right)^{3/2}}
$$</tex>

this would have given us:

<tex>$$
m(r) \, = \, {1\over G}\, r^2{d\Phi \over dr}
\, = \, M\, {r^3 \over \,\left(r^2 + a^2\right)^{3/2}} \, = \,
M\left(1+{a^2\over r^2}\right)^{-3/2}
$$</tex>

*Alice*: Quite a bit faster than my juggling of integrals!  We could have
used a healthy dose of physical intuition, before embarking on that lengthy
computation.

== An Intuitive Derivation

*Bob*: Now that we have found the radius dependence of the cumulative mass,
we only have to invert that relationship, to get the dependence of cumulative
mass on radius.  That shouldn't be too hard.  However, I'm getting tired of
carrying along the factors <tex>$M$</tex> and <tex>$a$</tex> which we
may as well consider to be the physical units used for measuring
<tex>$m$</tex> and <tex>$r$</tex>, so that the latter are used as
dimensionless parameters.  Setting <tex>$M=a=1$</tex>, we can write:

<tex>$$
m(r) \, = \, r^3\left(r^2 + 1\right)^{-3/2} \, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
m^{-2/3} \, = \, r^{-2}\left(r^2 + 1\right) \, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
r^2 m^{-2/3} \, = \, \left(r^2 + 1\right) \, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
r^2\left(m^{-2/3}-1\right) \, = \, 1  \, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

:equation:
r(m) \, = \, \left(m^{-2/3}-1\right)^{-1/2}

which is indeed eq. (ref(rmahw) that you asked me to derive.  No need to
trust anybody anymore!  We have derived it from first principles.

*Alice*: But you'd better explain your students how you can restore the
correct factors of <tex>$M$</tex> and <tex>$a$</tex>, otherwise they
will think that you were cutting corners.

*Bob*: Good point.  It takes a while to learn to think in terms of
dimensionless quantities, and to transform easily and confidently
between those and the corresponding physical quantities.  In this
case, I can just point out that the dimensionless quantity
<tex>$r$</tex> has to be replaced by <tex>$r/a$</tex>, and the
dimensionless quantity <tex>$m$</tex> has to be replaced by
<tex>$m/M$</tex>.  We then get:

:equation:
r(m) \, = \, {a \over \sqrt{\left({M\over m}\right)^{2/3}-1}}

*Alice*: That is correct, but if I were your student, I would be rather
surprised.  I would argue that a piece of wood with a length of 1 foot
has also a length of 12 inches.  So you have to multiply the unit of
length with the dimensionless number 1 or 12, as the case may be, to get
the physical length.  So I would ask: why are you _dividing_ <tex>$r$</tex>
by the length scale <tex>$a$</tex>?

*Bob*: Yes, students do indeed ask such questions!  It just means that they
have to practice more with simple examples, until it comes to them naturally.

*Alice*: Well, that is not really answering the question.  My answer would be
to introduce two different sets of symbols, to remove the confusion between the
physical quantities and the dimensionless quantities.

*Bob*: I won't stop you!

== A Formal Derivation

*Alice*: If you define

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
r \, &=& \, \xi a \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
m \, &=& \, \mu M
\end{array} \right.

you can point out that <tex>$r$</tex> and <tex>$a$</tex> are physical
quantities, while <tex>$\xi$</tex> is the dimensionless quantity
connecting them.  Similarly, <tex>$m$</tex> and <tex>$M$</tex> are
physical quantities, while <tex>$\mu$</tex> is the dimensionless quantity
giving the variable quantity <tex>$m$</tex> in terms of the mass unit
<tex>$m$</tex>.  We can then write:

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
\xi \, &=& \, {\displaystyle {r\over a}} \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
\mu \, &=& \, {\displaystyle {m\over M}}
\end{array} \right.

This makes is possible to write your derivation without any shortcuts,
in a mathematical precise way.

<tex>$$
m \, = \, M r^3\left(r^2 + a^2\right)^{-3/2} \, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
\mu M \,=\, M (\xi a)^3\left((\xi a)^2 + a^2\right)^{-3/2} \,\Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
\mu \, = \, \xi^3\left(\xi^2 + 1\right)^{-3/2} \, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
\mu^{-2/3} \, = \, \xi^{-2}\left(\xi^2 + 1\right) \, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
\xi^2 \mu^{-2/3} \, = \, \left(\xi^2 + 1\right) \, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
\xi^2\left(\mu^{-2/3}-1\right) \, = \, 1  \, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
\xi(\mu) \, = \, \left(\mu^{-2/3}-1\right)^{-1/2} \, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
{r(m)\over a} \, = \, \left(\left({M\over m}\right)^{2/3}-1\right)^{-1/2}
\, \Rightarrow \,
$$</tex>

<tex>$$
r(m) \, = \, {a \over \sqrt{\left({M\over m}\right)^{2/3}-1}}
$$</tex>

*Bob*: Yes, that is full mathematical rigor.  But of course, in practice,
you wouldn't go to such extravagance.  This is like what you were pushing
for earlier, with your request of putting hats on all kind of variables,
just because their mathematical functional form changed.  Since I'm a
physicist, I prefer to change notation only if the physical meaning
of the variables change.

*Alice*: I must admit, I often do use this type of switching of variables,
along the lines of what I just illustrated.  I can see that you're comfortable
with omitting that step, and that is mostly a matter of taste, I guess.
Still, you can't insist or wish that your students have the same quirks or
abilities as you.  So I suggest we at least add my derivation as well.

*Bob*: In that case I insist that we leave my derivation in too, for those
younger versions of me who already got the physics, and don't want to accrete
unnecesarry mathematical niceties.

*Alice*: So be it.
