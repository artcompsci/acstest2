Well, this occurs in a rather complex situation. Let me try to
explain:

not@artcompsci.org is translated to not@grape.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp
because of the setting we did for the web server.

From outside the U-tokyo astronomy department network, and mail which
directed to not@grape.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp or not@artcompsci.org is
actually sent to not@margaux.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp, which correctly
sends to you, me, and not@grape.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp. However, if I
send mail from within the astronomy department network, directly to
not@artcompsci.org, it is sent directly to
not@grape.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp, and it will not be further
forwarded.

This is somewhat inconvenient. I'll see if I can fix it.
