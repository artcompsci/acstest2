*Bob*: At first the Chin/Chen derivation seemed to work only if I would
arbitrarily change forces into accelerations.  I thought that I might
have made a mistake in my implementation, since I had only tested it
for equal masses, but when I tested it for the Pythagorean problem, my
old implementation was fourth-order, and the newly derived
implementation was only second order.  I was baffled.
