== Still more on acsdoc

Bug fix: Do not interpret *, -, indent etc in the region for inline
tex.


Minimal to do:

In latex generation

* include, link, title

* way to generate .tex instead of .x.cp

* something like <texonly> for use only inside tex


In HTML generation

* placement of tex image

* config file for macros for tex

* equation numbering?

I'll start with include and link

Include was rather easy (though not fully tested yet...)

Now for the link. Questions are:

- What image formats we should recognize
- What about image sizes

Other related problems

- equation numbering

- figure numbering

- generic label for link/index/tableofcontents

Go back to the image link:

Image formats which should clearly be recognized:

gif, jpeg (jpg or jpeg), png

This seems to be working now.

When I tried to process chapter 14, I found <tt>#ifdef</tt> is not
processed correctly. Hmm, which other characters should I handle?


(The following is actually written on 29th)

I put "#", "{", "}", "_" etc as things to be escaped. To force escape
"_" cause additional problem, since it made word markup for _italic_
treated not quite correctly, but what else can I do?
