Piet,

Here is my memo for what would go into ACS 1.0

If we really take the showing-out-everything approach, we will make
the entire ACS source/documents/notes tree (at least everything under
svn) visible (but not changable) from outside. So the simplest thing
would be to have index.html under $ACSROOT.

This top-level index.html then point to

--- online rdoc-generated book + ps+pdf
--- lab notes (if we really want....)
--- tarball of (probably) src+vol with versions

I guess it is probably okay to keep the online book (all of HTML, PS,
PDF), to be "latest", that is, the latest according to svn, as far as
we keep old versions with fixed version numbers on the web as
well. For books, it is also possible to keep old HTML/PS/PDF files,
not the tarballs, on the web, but that might be a bit too confusing,
since when people do Google search they might end up with some older
versions.

So I propose the web page structure of something like

index.html
  |
  |---- current book (PDF/PS)
  |
  |---- rdoc books
  |
  |---- tarballs of src+vol+PS+PDF+HTML
  |                          |-----version 1.0
  |                          |--version 1.1 ...
  |                          |--this week's snapshot(?)
  |                          |--today's snapshot
  |               
  |---- old book (the moving-star-around book)
             |
	     |--- HTML/PS/PDF
	     |--- source tarball---versions


I guess we want to make entire WWW site under SVN controll, and I
think it's probably okay to show the entire ACS source/vol tree itself
under WWW. Hmm, well, one problem is whether or not to allow svn
(read-only) access. For the time being, it might be better not to,
because there may be security concerns and we might need more
elaborate scheme to clear the security issues.
