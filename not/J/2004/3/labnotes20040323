== More on acsdoc

Probably we need some mechanism to break up lines, which are handled
by rdoc as preformatted, since we can have looooong lines from
automatic command output and things like that.

I (JM) will implement it at some point, as the second pass in the
preprocessing of the .cp files in acsdoc.rb. It is not necessarily the
preprocessing, but maybe cleaner that way than postprocess the
generated HTML file.

Also, it is quite likely that at some point we want to generate TeX
directly from rdoc or our .cp format file.
