 Hi Jun:
 
 I hope you got some rest this weekend!  As for me, I slept almost twelve
 hours, from Friday to Saturday.  Clearly, we've worked quite hard, the last
 two weeks.  But I'm very very pleased that we now have enough foundations
 built that we can start writing our second book (this is the first time in
 my life I have been able to write "we can start writing our second book" :>).
 
 I actually managed to write a non-trivial chapter (chapter 2).  I have just
 committed it to svn.  You can find it all in the directory acs/dia, and
 when you run the script that I explain in the next email, you'll see
 everything combined: code, book text, and lab notes.
 
 I'll divide my notes over a few different emails, so that it will be easier
 for you to reply to individual points.
 
 Piet

 Hi Jun:
 
 when we set up our current directory structures, ten days ago or so, we
 were still thinking about literature programming, with "acs/src" containing
 both code and book text combined in lit. prog. files.  However, now that
 we have coherent programming, we have three places for text: labnotes,
 code, and book chapters.
 
 How about the following toplevel directory structure:
 
 src (for code src)
 not (for lab notes)
 dia (for dialogues, i.e. our book series)
 bin
 doc (for toplevel "index.html" file perhaps; also other things??)
 
 Currently we also have "log".  I could not remember why, but thanks to our
 labnote mechanism, with a "find" under html I quickly found it, in session
 "Fri Dec 19 18:45:30 EST 2003 -- Piet Hut" (isn't that nice ?!?!!):
 
   log: this contains automatically generated version of the lab notes,
        in ps, pdf, and html format
 
 Instead of "dia" we could use "nar" for narrative; or "vol" for volumes,
 i.e. book volumes, but that is probably not so clear; "txt" is possible,
 but suggests ascii text.  Do you agree with "dia"?  For now, I have created
 that directory under svn; we can remove or rename it if you prefer.
 
 I guess it is time to make a decision where to put all the rdoc output.
 It would certainly be nice to have it all combined, so that you can read
 labnotes and source code and bookchapters all in one rdoc browser session.
 For now, to be able to start writing chapters, I added the following line
 to my .cshrc file
 
     alias acsdoc 'cd $ACSROOT/dia ; \
       ruby $ACSROOT/src/coherent_programming/acsdoc.rb \
       --inline-source $ACSROOT/not/combined/* *.cp *.rb'
 
 When I run this, I get lab notes and chapters all nicely together.
 Shall we write a shell script to do this, and where shall we put it?
 Perhaps just in $ACSROOT/doc, or do you have another preference?

 Hi Jun:
 
 I wrote a script `svn_local_list.rb' which I can run without internet
 connection, to see which files are under svn control.  I put that in
 "ACS/bin".  Is that the right place to put it, do you think, or can
 you think of a better place?
 
 Also, shouldn't we place "$ACSROOT/src/labnotes/update-lab" in "ACS/bin"?
 And how about "$ACSROOT/src/coherent_programming/acsdoc.rb" ?
 
 By the way, in my first version of this script, I started with:
 
   unless entry_file = open(".svn/entries","r")
     raise "The current directory is not under subversion control"
   end
 
 However, this does not do the proper error handling.  I used the same format
 as what you used in "combine-notes.rb", but when I tried to run my script in
 a directory that is not under svn control, I got a real error message that
 was never captured by this "raise" command (it responded with:
 
    /home/piet/acs/bin/svn_local_list.rb:13:in `open': 
      No such file or directory - ".svn/entries" (Errno::ENOENT)
 	from /home/piet/acs/bin/svn_local_list.rb:13
 
 without ever seeing the second line with "raise" in it.  So I changed the
 first three lines above to
 
    fname = ".svn/entries"
    if FileTest.exist?(fname)
      entry_file = open(fname, "r")
    else
      print "The current directory is not under subversion control\n"
      exit
    end
 
 This is actually nicer, because it does not give any error message;
 in a way it is more appropriate to just print the message without
 shouting on the error stream ;>).
 Anyway, I guess this means that we have to use a different form of
 error handling in "combine-notes.rb" and "acsdoc.rb" as well.

 Hi Jun:
 
 I started to make the previous labnotes a bit prettier, replacing {\tt xx}
 by <tt>xx</tt>.  I guess one of the main things to do is to provide a
 mechanism to include figures in our labnotes, using rdoc.
 
 Do you have a suggestion for how to do this?
 
 More generally, I think it would be nice to have a single todo list
 somewhere.  For practical reasons, it might be nice to have it in the
 same directory as the combined lab note files.  We could simply name the
 file "acs/not/combined/todo", and then put it under rdoc with the rest of
 the lab files.
 
 Of course, unlike the lab files, this file would be changed all the time.
 I don't mind.  Do you?

 Hi Jun:
 
 I added a couple lines to the preprocessor we wrote,
 acs/src/coherent_programming/acsdoc.rb, macros to allow us to `talk' to
 each other while writing book text.  However, it will get a bit unwieldy
 if we just keep adding lines to that file.  Please have a look, and let
 me know what you prefer.  What I added was:
 
     s.gsub!(/<p>/, '<i>[Jun: ')
     s.gsub!(/<\/p>/, ' -- Piet] </i>')
     s.gsub!(/<j>/, '<i>[Piet ')
     s.gsub!(/<\/j>/, ' -- Jun] </i>')
 
 So now in the text of the book you can write "<j>some comments</j>"
 and they will show up as in italic as "[Piet: some comments -- Jun]".

 Hi Jun:
 
 As I mentioned in my first message, I have split up my reactions over a
 few email messages, to make it easier for us to react further.  Now the
 question arises: what are the next steps.
 
 I can continue writing book chapters, but I would like to know first whether
 you are happy with my approach.  Does what I have written give the right
 level of detail, or should we explain more?
 
 Also, I'm not so happy with the fact that I wrote five different versions
 of the body class, as you can see in Chapter 2.  Besides it being quite a
 clutter, it confuses rdoc, since all five define similar methods, and each
 method shows up separately on the html screen.  I could give each class a
 different name, "Body01" in file "body01.rb", "Body02" in file "body02.rb",
 but then we have a duplications of many different classes.  Perhaps this is
 better, but maybe there is an even better method.
 
 Finally, I think I was quite clumsy with the way in which I combined lab
 notes and code and book text for rdoc.  When I look at the directories
 under acs/dia, I get:
 
 <pctmp63|/home/piet/acs/dia> listdir
 ./
 ./doc/
 ./doc/classes/
 ./doc/files/
 ./doc/files/home/
 ./doc/files/home/piet/
 ./doc/files/home/piet/acs/
 ./doc/files/home/piet/acs/not/
 ./doc/files/home/piet/acs/not/combined/
 <pctmp63|/home/piet/acs/dia> 
 
 So somehow my whole ACSROOT, /home/piet/acs, gets repeated underneath
 /home/piet/acs/dia/doc/files, which cannot be a good way of doing things.
 Do you have a better suggestion?
 
 Cheers,
 
 Piet
