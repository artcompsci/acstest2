Well, now it *should* work. By sending mail to either
not@artcompsci.org (Cced to Piet and Jun) or notonly@..., you can add
notes automatically to the svn repository at grape (after 1 munutes or
so). So, by svn update, you get files in Mail/200x/x. update-lab is
changed to look at Mail/xxxx/xx as well. Also, not/TODO is now
included in update-lab.

We'll see if this file will appear in the right place or not.
