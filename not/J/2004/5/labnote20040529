== Integration of the old bool (Moving Stars Around)

I created $ACSROOT/msa directory, where the first book (MSA) will be
kept. It has two subdirectories, web and originals, the former has
PDF, PS and HTML versions (not under svn) and the latter tex, C++ and
other source files (under svn)

To add all files which were under CVS to SVN, I wrote a simple scipt:

cvs_list_files.rb:

  def cvs_files(dirname)
    p dirname
    files=[]
    entry = dirname + "/CVS/Entries"
    unless File.exist?(entry) 
      return []
    end
    s = open(entry,"r"){|f| f.gets("")}.split("\n")
    s.each{|x|
      a=x.split("/")
      if a[0] =~ /^D$/ 
        if a[1]
  	print "descending to ", a[1], "\n"
  	files.push(dirname+ "/"+a[1])
  	files += cvs_files(dirname+"/"+a[1])
        end
      else
        files.push(dirname+ "/"+a[1])
  #      p dirname+ "/"+a[1]
      end
    }
    files
  end
  
  x= cvs_files(ARGV[0])
  p "end of cvs_files"
  x.each{|y| 
    print "svn add -N "+y+"\n"
    system("svn add -N "+y+"\n")
  }

I do not plan to use this many times, and therefore it is currntly not
under svn (location in my local machine is $ACSROOT/src/utilities)

The MSA book is at the directory msa/original/books/vol_1. The
Makefile there looks okay, but I need to change Makefile.local so that
the PDF files etc will appear at "web" directory when make install is
tried.

I also added Makefile to each of msa/ original/ books/ directories, so
that I can just say make at msa to re-create the PDF files etc.
