Wonderful, very nice and convenient.  I also like the style.

Okay, I added all the email of the last few days, before you started
the "not@..." mechanism.  It was a bit tricky, since the date at which
I was writing was sometimes switching past midnight in Princeton,
although it was in the middle of the day here.  Oh well, at least it
is all there now.

So now the lab notes for the last two months should be self contained
and complete!

However, I think I did something wrong, since now the labnotes file
for 2003/12 comes up in my rdoc window with a grey-white color smeared
over the normally bright blue color of the banner at the file header.
The grey smear continues for about the first half of the file, then
things get clearer again.  I put a white space at the front of each
line in all the email files that I committed, but I guess there are
still other commands somewhere that are funny, some email directives
that confuse rdoc?  Well, I guess we can check that later, unless you
immediately see what went wrong.
