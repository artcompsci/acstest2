That's a good idea!

Okay.

Okay, that makes sense, the only question is whether it is not confusing
to have an output like:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 yebisu>diff test.out test-io.out
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But I gues people will understand that it means there is no difference.

Okay, we can leave this for now and decide this later.
