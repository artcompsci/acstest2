Great!

I just tested it.
You can see how I implemented it in the litterature chapter, at the
very end of volume 0.
It is nicely clickable under rdoc, and it looks good under ps.

Two glitches:

1) long web names run off the page now in TeX, and since some web
   names can be veeeeery long, this may be a problem.

2) under rdoc, the "next" and "previous" tabs in the 

      kali/vol/vol-0/doc/files/_/_litt_ok.html

   file somehow don't work.

Thanks for the great improvement!

Piet
