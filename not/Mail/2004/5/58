I think I forgot to tell you (actually I forgot that this
functionality can be used this way...), but that functionality
actually exists. In .acsdocinitrc file, you can define the following
four variables:

  @@additional_preambles_for_tex = ""
  @@additional_commands_for_tex = ""
  @@additional_preambles_for_inline_tex = ""
  @@additional_commands_for_inline_tex = ""

"preambles" and "commands" are code added before and after
"\begin{document}", and variables with "inline" are for tex code used
to HTML embedded inline tex images, and without "inline" are
single-file latex translation. For example, if you have

  @@addtional_commands_for_tex = "\\input defs"
  @@additional_commands_for_inline_tex = "\\input defs"

"\input defs" is added after "\begin{document}", for both of the
single tex file created by "--tolatex" and individual tex file for
HTML documents. So you can use "defs.tex" as file for standard
macros.
