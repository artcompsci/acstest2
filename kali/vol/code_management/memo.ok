Okay, well, so we should have, for each volume directory
 
  * some way to specify which files are commnds
  * some way to specify which files are libraries
 
And, we need a way to specify
 
  * directory to install commands
  * directory to install libraries
  * (checking stuff I wrote above)
 
Hmm, well, this means that we need some startup or initialization
script (sourced in .cshrc), which add things like environmental
variables and command search path.
 
Shall I implement some prototype?

Yes, please!  And in our volumes, we can describe this either
in volume 3b (user interface) or in volume 4 (ACS data format).
That way, I can then start writing volumes 3b,4,5,etc, using this
new convention.  We could also write a new volume about it.

What do you think is best: put it in volume 3b (user interface) or
in volume 4 (ACS data format), or in a new volume (libraries and
code management)?

We need to add: some more in makefile. Current makefile has:


 SRC =  title.ok pref.ok  ch01.ok  ch02.ok  ch03.ok  ch04.ok \
        ch05.ok  ch06.ok  ch07.ok  ch08.ok  ch09.ok  ch10.ok litt.ok

 TARGET = volume1c

 include ../etc/Makefile.inc

One question is if it is better to use rake, but perhaps better to
start with something we are used to.

I guess what is necessary is:

  RUBYLIBS = ...
  RUBYCOMMANDS = ...

This means we need to specify the directories to copy these.

First, library:

The standard is what is in $LOAD_PATH. I think, however, it is better
to add the ACS specific location to this $LOAD_PATH, than to
the contaminate standard place with ACS-specific stuff.

So, the simplest solution is $ACSROOT/rubylib.

The name RUBYxxx is not ideal (some things may be csh/bash script or
something completely different). Better to have something like

   LIBSRCS = ...
   SCRIPTSRCS = ...
   
For the time being, I'd just put things at

  $ACSROOT/lib (referred to as ASCSCRIPTS)
  $ACSROOT/bin (referred to as ASCLIBS)

One question: Where to put the files which are used to keep the
makefiles and others working. If Makefile.inc uses some Ruby scripts,
the scripts themselves should live in some volume directory. On the
other hand, it seems better to have them in the above ACSSCRIPTS
directory, to keep thing simple.

If both files are under svn, this may be a bit inconvenient, since svn
would think the files are updated each time source file is copied to
the target directory. To avoid this, I simply run "diff" before
actually updating file.
