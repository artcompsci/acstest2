1. Gravitylab

We started the filetransfer to set up a CVS version of our gravitylab
software in Strasbourg.

2. Pgplot

We decided to switch from Gnuplot, which we used for gravitylab, to
pgplot for ACS 0.1.  We wrote an email to Tim, the person maintaining
pgplot, to ask for his permission to put a version of pgplot up on our
web site.

3. Plans for the coming three days

First we will finish writing the labnote software.  Next we will start
to experiment with literate programming, using docbook.  We may want
to write our own version of a translator from a simple subset of Latex
to XML, in a similar way as we are writing a translator for our labnotes,
from a small subset of Latex to HTML.  Finally, we will start to write
a version of an individual timestep program, after first cleaning up
our current version nbody_sh1.rb.

4. Nbody class structure

We will rewrite nbody_sh1.rb to define a class Nbody, that contains
all data for a star cluster or other type of Nbody system, together
with a single variable @bodies.  The variable can the be associated
with an array, or a tree, or a hash table, or whatever else we like
to choose or design.  The minimal requirement is that @bodies is an
object for which Enumerable is mixed in, so that we can ask it to do
an @bodies.each operation.
