At least, we need to be able to move between two state at any time,
not only at the era boundary, just to make sure some hyperbolic
encounters with very small periastron distance are handled
correctly.

My feeling is that Worldbundle class might not be necessary. Also,
Snapshot class is just a convenient way for the WorldEra to process
requests from outside, and in principle should not be visible from
outside....

Okay,

Not yet... I'll be leaving to Airport in a few minutes.
