 I just installed it too, without any problem.  I already noticed that
 the README file is in rdoc format.  Very nice to have things in one
 format, that way.

 Great, thanks!  I just saw that you had already added something to
 acsdoc.rb along these lines.  Is this work in progress?  Should I
 look at it or try something, or are you in the middle of working on it?

 A post-processor would seem like a very dirty way, and probably not
 very reliable(?).  I would prefer to just change the source code for
 now, in a very modest and minimum way, and to keep track of the
 changes made.
 
 Later on, after we put ACS 0.1 on the web, we can ask Dave Thomas
 whether he would be willing to add some or all of them to his system.
 Certainly the option to provide straight HTML commands would be one
 that many people would use; and perhaps some of your other additions
 will be useful to others as well.  At the very least, he might be
 convinced to add a mechanism to allow changes in a more transparant
 way; we'll see.

 These are all difficult decisions.  I feel different about them on
 different days ;>).  Perhaps better not to couple ACS x.y releases
 and books; we may want to do more releases and/or more books at some
 points in time.
 
 Numbering or not is really a very difficult question.
 Half of me thinks it is better, to give people a handle on the books.
 Half of me thinks it is better not, to give us freedom.
 
 Hmmmm.  Right now, I feel half + epsilon in favor of numbering.
 That has the great advantages that we can answer a question by saying:
 look in ACS vol. 3, chapter 6.
 
 Now a big question is then: do we call "Moving Stars Around" volume 0?
 Or better to leave that out of the numbering system altogether?
 
 Here is one option.  I don't know whether it's a good idea.  We could
 start volume 1 by letting Bob tell Alice that there are some students
 we wrote nbody_sh1.C with relatively little help from him; he just
 gave the other Alice (the student) some advice when she asked him.
 They then look at the code, and talk about how difficult it is nowadays
 to start something new, in a world full of big packages and legacy code;
 it was so different when Alice (the prof) was starting, 25 years ago!
 Hmmmm.  Wat do you think?

 "Writing simple N-body programs" is a good idea.  However, already the
 presence of variable time steps makes it move in the direction of
 dense stellar systems, as opposed to galactic dynamics and collisionless
 stellar dynamices in general.  If we then introduce individual time steps,
 we definitely specialize.  So we could try to be a bit more specific,
 given that our programs will not be that "simple" after all.
 Or we could show the world how complicated our notion of "simple"
 already is, and stick to your suggestion: "Writing simple N-body programs".
 
 These decisions are extremely important, perhaps more than anything
 else we decide, since these titles are going to become our public face,
 they will be what people will remember about ACS.

 What a great idea, "book shelf", I like that!  But first we have to
 decide whether to number or not.
