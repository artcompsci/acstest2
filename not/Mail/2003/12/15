Well, the directory structure has little to do with the way the files
appear to the brouser.  We can make

* list of BUGS as single, big file
* list of BUGS as links to single files
* or whatever we can think of

from BUGS/200x/x structure.

I guess a question would be what we want to do with additional
comments on bug reports, or bug fixes. At least for the time being, we
can just add notes to the particular BUG report file, I think.

No. I think TODO list must be short. It may be a good exercise to move
the entries of TODO list to lab notes, presumablly manually.
