= TODO for acs

Time-stamp: <2004-01-19 17:23:02 piet>

* in ch2.cp, in:

  <tt>:inccode: .leap.rb+write</tt>

  acsdoc picks up <tt>nbody.write</tt> instead of <tt>body.write</tt>

  Perhaps we can implement <tt>.leap.rb+body.write</tt> ?

  That way, having +def+ and +end+ in the same column may no longer be
  necessary (though still a good idea!)

  Of course, we can make this arbitrarily complicated, but perhaps it
  would be worth while to allow something like <tt>.leap.rb+body</tt>
  for including the whole class definition of <tt>body</tt>, although
  we then probably would have to add some form of numbering, given that
  there are various additions, all called <tt>body</tt> class in the
  file <tt>leap.rb</tt>; perhaps <tt>.leap.rb+body+3</tt> ?  Hmmmm....

* how about replacing

  <tt>segment start: <i>name</i></tt>

  by 

  <tt>segment: <i>name</i></tt>

  ?

* what about <tt>sample_init.rb</tt> ?  Leave out opening specific files?

* what about empty lines at the very end of our current <tt>ch2.rb</tt>

* how to run acsdoc; for only one chapter at a time?

* a cleanup mechanism for all the <tt>.something</tt> files?

* we haven't yet succeeded in including figures in our old lab notes;
  the following, at the end of section 3.3 in <tt>labnotes031112</tt>
  did not work (I'm using LINK instead of link, to get the output here):

  <tt>LINK:../P/2003/11/images/labnote-031112.gif</tt>

* in this same file, in <tt>5. Generation of Lab Notes</tt>
  mysteriously the number 5 becomes 1 !?!

* we should implement Ato's errata in our first book:

 Dear Piet and Jun,
  I have started reading "The Art of Computational Science". I do not know
  if the version on the web is the latest and if you are interested in
  hearing bug reports, but I thought I would let you know of some typos
  I noticed in the book. 
  
  7.2 A Standard $N$-Body Snapshot Format
   
  after the paragraph that starts with "For example, to store the initial..."
  the given example has one line too many.
   
  - - -
   
  after the paragraph that starts with "As soon as our program starts..."
  the array indices are all 0, they should be 0, 1, and 2
   
  - - -
   
  11.4 Dynamically Produced Binaries
   
 in Alice, starting with "You may not have heard of it...", says "Monte Carol",
  should be "Monte Carlo", spoils the joke that comes afterward :-)
  
  I hope you find this useful,
  
  cheers,
  
  ato

* in our book, we may want to say a few more words about the notion of
  the `order' of a differential equation?  This was the main point of
  criticism that Bob Vanderbei mentioned.

* in our labnotes and elsewhere, how/when shall we implement reference
  pointers?

* what shall we do with a table of contents, for our book in rdoc?

* are <tt>!name!</tt> and <something> useful, as mentioned
  in <tt>rdoc-0.9.0acs1/README.local</tt> ?
