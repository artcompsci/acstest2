= A Special Second-Order Differential Equation

Now that we know how to solve a first-order differential equation, we
can extend our methods immediately to treat the case of a general
second-order differential equation

:equation:
{d^2x \over dt^2} = f\left(x, {dx \over dt}\right)

Here the force per unit mass <tex>$f(x)$</tex> exerted on a particle depends
explicitly on both the position and the velocity of that particle.
An example is such a force is the motion of a mass point under the
influence of friction.  Indeed, our physical interpretation of the
case of a first-order differential equation followed from the above
form in the limit of infinitely strong friction, where the
velocity-dependent term dominated completely.  Another example would
be the force that is felt by an electron moving in an electromagnetic
field (where <tex>$x$</tex> would have be interpreted as a three-dimensional
vector).

The second-order equation above can be rewritten as a system of two
first-order differential equations:

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
\dot x &=& v \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
\dot v &=& f(x, v)
\end{array} \right.

In our case of interest, classical mechanics, we will drop the
velocity dependence, and study instead the simpler equation:

:equation:
{d^2x \over dt^2} = f(x)

which, using vector notation, can be translated into the system:

:equation:
{\dot x \choose \dot v} = {v \choose f(x)}

As we will see in the next section, we can exploit the simple form of
these two equations to get an extra order of accuracy, seemingly for
free.  However, in order to put this clever trick in a clear context,
in the current section we will be less clever.  Rather, we will simply
apply the same treatment that we have developed in the previous section.

== One Force Evaluation per Step

Everything we did in the previous section carries over directly to the
case of two coupled differential equations.  To show this, let us
repeat the same derivation, but now in vector form.  At the start of a
time step, we evaluate the right-hand side of the differential
equation at <tex>$t=0$</tex>:

:equation:
\vec k_1 = {v_0 \choose f_0}

This leads to the following dimensionally correct expression:

:equation:
{x_1 \choose v_1} = {x_0 \choose v_0} + \alpha_1 \vec k_1\tau =
{x_0 + \alpha_1 v_0 \tau \choose v_0 + \alpha_1 f_0\tau}

Comparing this with our Taylor series:

:equation:
\label{taylor12}
{x_1 \choose v_1} = {x_0 \choose v_0} + 
{v_0\choose a_0}\tau + \half {a_0 \choose j_0} \tau^2 +
O(\tau^3) 

we see that

:equation:
{\alpha_1 v_0 = v_0 \choose \alpha_1 f_0 = a_0}

The first line gives

:equation:
\alpha_1 = 1

and indeed this makes the second line into the correct expression:

:equation:
a_0 = f_0

as dictated by the differential equation.  We can write our results in
a more traditional form, using a scalar expression for <tex>$k_1$</tex>, rather
than a vector expression, as follows:

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
x_1 &=& x_0 + v_0 \tau \\
v_1 &=& v_0 + k_1 \tau  \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
k_1 &=& f(x_0)
\end{array} \right.

We thus recover the forward-Euler algorithm.  As before, 
this scheme is only first-order accurate, since it cannot possibly
reproduce the <tex>$O(\tau^2)$</tex> term in Eq. (ref(taylor12)).

== Two Force Evaluations per Step

When we allow two force evaluations, we again are left with one free
parameter <tex>$\alpha$</tex>.  Let us first recall what we found in the case of
a first-order differential equation:

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
x_1 &=& x_0 + \left( (1-\alpha)k_1 + \alpha k_2 \right) \tau \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
k_1 &=& f(x_0)  \\
k_2 &=& f(x_0 + {1\over 2 \alpha} k_1 \tau)
\end{array} \right.

In our case, this translates directly to

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
x_1 &=& x_0 + v_0 \tau +
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}((1-\alpha)k_1 + \alpha k_2 )\tau^2  \\
v_1 &=& v_0 + ((1-\alpha)k_1 + \alpha k_2 )\tau  \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
k_1 &=& f(x_0) \\
k_2 &=& f(x_0 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2\alpha}} v_0 \tau)
\end{array} \right.

In particular, for <tex>$\alpha = \half$</tex> we find

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
x_1 &=& x_0 + v_0 \tau +
{\textstyle\frac{1}{4}}(k_1 + k_2)\tau^2  \\
v_1 &=& v_0 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(k_1 + k_2)\tau  \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
k_1 &=& f(x_0) \\
k_2 &=& f(x_0 + v_0 \tau)
\end{array} \right.

and for <tex>$\alpha = 1$</tex> we find

:equation:
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
x_1 &=& x_0 + v_0 \tau +
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_2\tau^2  \\
v_1 &=& v_0 + k_2 \tau  \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
k_1 &=& f(x_0) \\
k_2 &=& f(x_0 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} v_0 \tau)
\end{array} \right.
