 Okay.

 Could have Douglas. Either way is fine.

 Cluster... Associlation? Galaxy? Zoo, Museum, Exploratorium, or we

 Hmm, well, this would enforce linear structure again. If you like
 that, just call it book 1 is fine too.

 I feel against "Designing" or "Laying foundations" , since they sound
 like we are not doing real lab work there, but just drawing figures or
 building labs. Also, for the large part of the book 1 (well, I think
 I'd prefer "book 1" after all), we will be talking about nbody_sh1. So
 how about "Writing simple N-body programs?"

 As I wrote, "executables" should appear in, say, $ACSBIN, but here I
 guess I'm talking about the source code and its document, which should
 be under src/xxx.

 I guess we basically decided that ALL "source" code will be under
 "src/xxx".

 So not/TODO? That's fine. For BUGS, what I meant is to have
 
 not/BUGS/200x/x
 
 in other words, exactly the same structure as J/ and P/. Is this what
 you thought?

 Ya, I think this form is actually better, unless you want more fancy
 things like changing colors or fonts (that might actually be useful, though)

 Okay. Well, now the question is:
 
 Should we write them for shared timestep or individual timestep?
 
 The point is, for more complex algorithm, you can show the power of
 high-level languages more clearly. For something simple any language
 is okay.

 Well, to setup everything on grape.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp is *fairly*
 easy (I mean something like half-day work). However, there is related
 question which is addressed in your next message:
 
 
 Subject: Re: Wiki vs. rdoc

 One extreme is to put all notes to Wiki, which does offer most of the
 things we need for lab notes system, and certainly fits best to 
 the open source or open whatever concept.
 
 If we use rdoc and current system, we do need to device some mechanism
 to extend colaborators, and that's some additional work (though not
 much). Also, the document structure may be too linear-oriented. (as
 our original intention was linear log file) This is however probably
 not much limitation, if we have easy way to make links to old notes
 (which we should).
 
 But more important difference is in the basic philosophy. Wiki
 is, well, completely anarchistic, with intended no restriction on what
 anyone can do to any page under Wiki. I'm not sure if we want that
 level of openness.
