== More on tarball for the versioned ACS site

The tarball should contain

* ALL files archived in svn
* ALL files under doc directories
* Some of specified files, such as vol/vol-1/volume1.ps (if exists)
  etc.

Anything else?

== acsdoc more changes:

Now it accepts two extentions (.cp and .ok) as the file name for the
text files.
