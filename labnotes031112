Hi Erik:

Greetings from Japan, where I just arrived, for a two-months stay in Kyoto.
Part of this time I'll be working with my collaborator, Jun Makino, so now
we're in a position to take up where we left off, at the end of September.

Thank you again!  Jun and I decided to go for the docbook approach
that you showed us in this example.

Did you get a chance to dig this up?  Sounds like a nice tool!

For now, indeed it strikes us as the best approach to go for graphics.
This probably means doing a LaTeX pass and then produce little ps files
for each equation, right?  As long as MathML remains in its currently
unsupported state, we might just as well write the equations directly
into LaTeX, with which we are already familiar.

By the way, Jun and I have also been thinking more about the so-called
"literate programming" approach, writing book text and computer code
together in one file, which makes it much less likely that the two get
out of sinc during revisions.  This then needs some automatic process
to get the book and the code extracted from the common source.  As I
mentioned a while ago, we were fascinated by the description given by
Norm Walsh, on his web site:

   "http://nwalsh.com/docs/articles/xml2002/lp/paper.html"

You responded to my previous mentioning of this:

We would like to send him an email to see whether he may be interested
in giving some advice (and on the off chance that he, too, might be
curious about the gravitational N-body problem).  Would you mind sending
him a short email with CC to us, to introduce us to him, so that he
knows we are serious (and basically good folks ;>) ?

Thanks a lot!

Piet

2. Version Control

Yesterday we outlined a plan to maintain two places where we
accumulate files, `source' and `lab notes'.  The source files will be
written in a literate programming style, while the lab notes will form
a type of journal or diary.  For the lab notes, the notes from each new
session will be added to the end.  The software we need to automate
that process will be written by us later this week.  For the source,
we need some form of version control.

2.1. Subversion

Our first thought was to use CVS, the version control program that is
most widely in use.  But then Jun remembered having heard about a new
system, Subversion, that has an interface similar to that of CVS, but
has eliminated many annoying limitations of CVS.  We looked at the
documentation and decided to try it out for our toy project.

In fact, our toy project now serves many functions: 1) originally,
i.e. yesterday morning, we proposed it in order to try out our new
style of interface specification; 2) then, yesterday afternoon, we
proposed using it to try out our new lab note writing system; 3)
finally, today we decided to use it to also test our new version
control system.

2.2. Setting up a Repository

Jun spent a couple hours to understand and install subversion on both
of our computers.  We then set up a subversion repository on his
computer in Tokyo, and we both checked out a version, even though the
repository at that moment was still empty.  As our first file, we
began to write the labnotes for the previous day, named "labnotes031111".

That previous day, we had decided to write automated software that
will convert the lab notes for a session to the HTML version.
However, at that time we had not yet thought through what exactly we
wanted to translate automatically in what way.  As a consequence, we
had only a vague idea of what the such lab session notes would look
like.  This was the main reason that we did not take notes that day,
and postponed the note taking to today.

3. Lab Notes File Format

3.1. Headers and Paragraphs

Having our new subversion system in place, we thus started to write
"labnotes031111".  We began by writing text, but quickly we found that
it would be nice to add a fine grained level of sections, subsections,
etc.  This in turn gave us the idea to define a specific file format,
starting with a one line header containing time, place, and persons,
followed by a ([sub]*)section tree.  A blank line indicates a new
paragraph, as in LaTeX.

Here is a possible syntax.  Two blank lines will be translated into
paragraph breaks, and a single line starting with a number will be
interpreted as a header for a section or subsection.  If you really
want to write a paragraph containing only one short sentence starting
with a number, you will have to add a backslash: "\8" at the start of
a one-line paragraph will be interpreted as "8", while "\\8" will be
interpreted as "\8", for those rare one-line paragraphs that really
want to start with a backslash followed by a character 8.

3.2. Suffix

We gave this format a name: a file in this format will end with the
suffix ".not", short for "notes" as in "lab notes".

3.3. Including Figures

We decided to copy the figure that we had drawn on the blackboard, and
Jun redrew it, using the program {\tt tgif}.  In order to include that
figure in our lab notes for yesterday's session, we had to define a
syntax for figure inclusion.  We decided that it would be of the type
"\\fig{filename, size}", written on a separate line, with blank lines
before and after.  For example, yesterday's figure was included using
the following line:

\\fig{labnote.eps, 15 cm}

3.4. Italic, Boldface, Colors, and all that

We will define a limited number of text formatting, to indicate for
example the use of italic or boldface text, the use of different
colors, and so on.  We will allow a few different ways to define those
formatting options.  For example, an equal space typewriter font could
be defined as \begintt \\begintt tgif \\endtt \endtt in LaTeX style,
or as <tt> \<tt\> tgif \</tt\> </tt>.

4. Lab Notes File Types

4.1. Different .html Options

Yesterday we decided to concatenate all lab sessions' notes, after
translating them into HTML, into one long separate file for each month.
Today, however, we realized that it would be better to give the user
the choice to either create long files, one for each months, or short
files, one for each session.

4.2. From .html to .pdf Files

Yesterday, we thought about an automated translation process from our
own session note taking format to HTML.  Our idea was to make web
pages the designated output format for our notes.  Today, however, we
realized that it would be nice to produce pdf files as well.  For one
thing, it would make it much easier to print out individual sessions.

4.3. Preserving the Original .not Files

Then we thought about possible future extensions.  Who knows what
other files types we would like to use as targets.  This prompted us
to make sure to keep copies of our session notes in their original form.

4.4. Uploading .not Sessions

One allowed option would be for each of us to write a new .not file
for each session.  The automated software would then simply append
that session's file to the mother .not file.  Another option would be
for each of us to keep a complete copy of the mother file, and write
the new session's lab notes at the end of the file.  The automated
software would then recognize which part to take from the end, and to
append that to the mother file.  And finally, it should also be okay
to take an intermediary approach, to keep for example a file with the
last few dozen sessions, and write the new session's note at the end
of that file.

4.5. Warnings and Errors

When uploading a new lab session, the automated software will flag
differences between older sessions in one of our personal copies of
the lab notes and the lab note mother file.  In that case, a warning
will be issued, as long as the new session can be cleanly appended to
the end of the mother file.  Seeing such a warning will inform the
person doing the update that there is something corrupted in his own
copy of the lab notes.  However, if the latest lab session does not
appear at the very end of the personal copy of the lab notes, an error
will be issued, since in that case it is not possible to decide what
went wrong and how it could possible be corrected automatically.

5. Generation of Lab Notes

We extended our ideas about generation of labnotes (yesterday's 2.4.3),
to include not only the automatic generation of HTML files, but also
the generation of pdf files.  In addition, we will keep a mother file
that contains all submissions of .not files in chronological order.
Other options would be to translate the .not files into LaTeX files,
and to translate them into XML files as well (which in turn can then
be translated into LaTeX or HTML or pdf files).

We will allow errata and general comments to point back to a previous
session, which will then automatically add a pointer to the previous
session, pointing to the erratum text.  However, that last pointer
will not appear inside the text of that previous session, which can no
longer be changed, but rather at the top or bottom of that session, as
a form of metadata.

Finally, as we decided yesterday, we will allow the inclusion of
figures and LaTeX equations.  The images for the figures will be
automatically copied to the proper place so that they can be accessed
by the HTML files that will include them.  For the specific case of
LaTeX equations that will be turned into figures, we will create a
special file "notdefs.tex".

6. Todo List

We made the following todo list:

-- finish writing yesterday's lab notes
-- implement block timestep code
-- write a Ruby implementation of our lab note mechanism
-- implement docbook XML version of our (book and code) source
-- work on a paper for the Kali code, using the block time step code
     as a toy model
