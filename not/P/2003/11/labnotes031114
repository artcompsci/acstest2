1. Emacs Outline Mode

1.1. Recognizing Sessions and (Sub)Sections

Piet defined an outline mode under emacs that recognizes the
(sub)sections of each session.  In order to allow us to fold up a
whole session, we wrote a short ruby program "not2outline.rb" which
converts the mother .not file "all.not" to a slightly different
format:

1) a "*" symbol is placed in front of the first line of each session,
   as the highest level in the outline mode;

2) an extra blank space is added to each blank line, except the last
   one of a session.  This allows a tighter listing of the (sub)section
   headers in outline mode (otherwise there would be blank lines visible
   even in folded mode), but it does show a desirable blank line at
   the end of a folded session.

1.2. Addition to .emacs File

In order to use this mode, add the following lines to your .emacs file:

\begincode

 ;; to let the outline mode work with the standard * symbols as well as
 ;; with a digit followed by a point ([0-9].) :
 (setq outline-regexp "\\*\\**\\|[0-9]\\.\\([0-9]\\.\\)*")

 ;; automatically go into outline mode for .not files:

 (setq auto-mode-alist
   (append '(("\\.not$"  . outline-mode)
            ) auto-mode-alist))

\endcode

1.3. Conversion Script

Here is the text of the Ruby conversion script:

\begincode

 #!/usr/local/bin/ruby -w
 #
 #  not2outline.rb
 #
 #  this script converts the "all.not" file to usage in emacs outline mode
 #
 #  usage:  not2outline.rb < all.not > allout.not
 #          emacs allout.not
 #
 
 while s = gets
   if s == "\n"
     print " \n"
   else
     print s
   end
   if s =~ /^\\header/
     s = gets until s != "\n"
     print "\n"
     print "* ", s
   end
 end

\endcode

2. Todo list

This is the second version of our Todo list \ref 2003-11-12-001-6.

-- implement the process for automatically updating the "all.not"
     mother file on the ACS server
-- automate inclusion of latex equations in figure form, and of
     general figures, in the conversion of .not files to .html file
-- implement docbook XML version of our (book and code) source
-- implement block timestep code
-- work on a paper for the Kali code, using the block time step code
     as a toy model
