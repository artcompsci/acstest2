You are probably right: there are always more changes than we expect.

I guess I was mainly thinking abou the place to refer to,
but you are right, we need both.

I thought about the human author doing this, but you are right,
that would not be too practical.  On the other hand, I don't see how
we can let acsdoc.rb do the work, if we sometimes change chapter
numbers.

Ah, now I understand your question better, about the "X" part.
I was just thinking about wo write something like:

   As we have seen earlier in our
   <a href=....#Name-here-must-be-unique-over-entire-ACS-or-Kali>
   discussion of initial conditions</a>, we can use . . . 

if the topic of where we point to happens to be initial conditions;
perhaps we do not have to give the specific title chapter?  I'm not
sure, this is a difficult question.

That is a VERY interesting solution.  I do like that (so I have to
correct your prediction ;>).
