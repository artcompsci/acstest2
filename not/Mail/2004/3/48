Piet,

I have modified and commited "acsdoc.rb". So now it should make files
like:

 .leap.rb+pp
  def pp                                # pretty print
    print "     N = ", @body.size, "\n"
    print "  time = ", @time, "\n"
    @body.each do |b| b.pp end
  end

  .leap.rb+pp+Body
  def pp               # pretty print
    print to_s
  end

  .leap.rb+pp+Nbody
  def pp                                # pretty print
    print "     N = ", @body.size, "\n"
    print "  time = ", @time, "\n"
    @body.each do |b| b.pp end
  end

The content of .leap.rb+pp is the last method which appears in the
source file with that name. Of course, if you have methods with the
same name in the same class multiple times (which is not impossible,
if you dynamically change the methods...), you would still have
problems.
