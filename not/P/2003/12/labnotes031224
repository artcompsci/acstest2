1. XML

We experimented with XML, docbook, openjade, and Norm Walsh's literate
programming implementation.

We were able to make openjade work for docbook, which created a nice
looking document.  For the literate programming example, we were able
to tangle and weave, producing the code part and the XML part, but
then we did not figure out how to transform the XML product into an
HTML file.
