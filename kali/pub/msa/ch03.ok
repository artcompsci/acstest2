= The Gravitational 2-Body Problem

== Absolute Coordinates

A decision was made to let Carol take the controls, for now.  Taking
the keyboard in front of a large computer screen, she opens a new file
<tt>nbody.rb</tt> in her favorite editor.  Expectantly, she looks at Erica,
sitting to her left, for instructions, but Dan first raises a hand.

*Dan*:
I'm a big believer in keeping things simple.  Why not start by coding up
the 2-body problem first, before indulging in more bodies?  Also, I
seem to remember from an introductory physics class for poets that the
2-body problem was solved, whatever that means.

*Erica*:
Good point.  Let's do that.  It is after all the simplest case that is
nontrivial: a 1-body problem would involve a single particle that is
just sitting there, or moving in a straight line with constant velocity,
since there would be no other particles to disturb its orbit.

And yes, the 2-body problem can be solved analytically.  That means
that you can write a mathematical formula for the solution.  For
higher values of N, whether 3 or 4 or more, no such closed formulas
are known, and we have no choice but to do numerical calculations in
order to determine the orbits.  For <tex>$N=2$</tex>, we have the
luxury of being able to test the accuracy of our numerical
calculations by comparing our results with the formula that Newton
discovered for the 2-body problem.

Yet another reason to start with <tex>$N=2$</tex> is that the
description can be simplified.  Instead of giving the <i>absolute</i>
positions and velocities for each of the two particles, with respect
to a given coordinate system, it is enough to deal with the
<i>relative</i> positions and velocities.  In other words, we can
transform the two-body problem into a one-body problem, effectively.

*Dan*: A one-body problem?  You mean that one body is fixed
in space, and the other moves around it?

*Carol*: I guess that one body is much more massive, so that it
doesn't seem to move much, while the other body moves around it.
When the Earth moves around the Sun, the Sun can almost be considered
to be fixed.  Similarly, when you look at the motion of the Moon around
the Earth: the Earth has a much larger mass than the Moon, and the mass
of the Sun is again much larger than that of the Earth.

*Erica*: Yes, a large mass ratio makes things simpler, but even for
the case where the masses are comparable, we can still talk about the
relative motion between the two particles.  There is no approximation
involved.  Here, let me draw a few pictures, to make it clear.

:figure: absolute_vectors.eps 6cm absolute_vectors
Two bodies with absolute coordinates <tex>$\br_1, \br_2$</tex>.

Since my notepad is two-dimensional, let us discuss the
two-dimensional two-body problem.  It will be trivial later to
generalize to three dimensions.  Here, in figure ref(absolute_vectors)
I show the positions of our two particles by drawing the position
vectors <tex>$\br_1, \br_2$</tex>.

*Carol*: But in order to define those vectors, you first have to choose
a coordinate system, right?

*Erica*: Yes.  We have to choose an <tex>$x$</tex> axis and a
<tex>$y$</tex> axis, and they together make up a coordinate system.
The point of intersection of the two axes is called the origin of the
coordinate system.  With respect to the origin, the positions of the two
bodies are pointed out by the tips of the arrows that stand for the two
vectors <tex>$\br_1, \br_2$</tex>.

*Dan*: I see the vectors, but I don't see the bodies.

*Erica*: You have to imagine the bodies to reside at the very end of each
arrow.

*Carol*: They are point masses, remember, so they are too small to see!

*Erica*: Well, yes, but of course I could still have drawn them as small
points.  However, I wanted to keep the figures simple.

== Coordinate Systems

*Dan*: What would happen if you had choosen a different coordinate system?

*Erica*: In that case, the tips of the arrows would stay at the positions
of the particles, since they would not change.  However, the arrows
themselves would change, because they would be rooted in the new origin.

*Dan*: But could you really have chosen <i>any</i> coordinate system?
And could you then let it change or rotate or let it jump up and down?
That seems rather unlikely.

*Erica*: Ah, no, certainly not.  Or more precisely, preferably not.
If you choose a coordinate system that moves in a strange way, you
then have to correct for those strange motions of the coordinate axes,
which would be reflected in the description of the motions of the
particles.  And you would then have to correct for that, in the
equations of motion.

*Carol*: I'm not sure I follow all that, but I guess the upshot is that
you want to keep things simple, and therefore you prefer to use coordinates
where the origin stays at rest in space.

*Erica*: Yes, either at rest, or otherwise the origin should move at a
constant speed in one fixed direction.  A coordinate system that moves
in such a way is called an inertial coordinate system.  By the way, we
use the term <i>uniform motion</i> for the type of motion that occurs
at constant speed in the same direction.

*Dan*: Ah, that is a term I remember from my physics class.  This is related
to the fact that Newton discovered, that an object which does not feel any
forces will keep moving in a straight line with constant speed.  Because
of the inertia of an object, you have to exert a force in order to change
that type of motion.

*Erica*: Indeed.  And this means that any object that feels no force will
move in a straight line at constant speed in any inertial coordinate system.
But if you start with, for example, a rotating coordinate system, then even
an object at rest seems to rotate in the opposite direction, when you describe
its motion with respect to the rotating frame.

*Dan*: And all of this is related to Newton's concept of absolute space,
right?  And Einstein showed that there is no such thing as absolute space.

*Erica*: The idea of an absolute space was a brilliant invention, very
useful to describe the phenomena on the level of classical mechanics.
But when you deal with high velocities, approaching the speed of light,
or even with lower velocities and very high accuracies, you have to take
into account the fact that special relativity gives a more accurate
description of the world.

*Carol*: And general relativity is even more accurate, I presume?

*Erica*: Yes, but in general relativity space and time are curved,
in a way that is influenced by the distribution of masses and energy
in the world.  This means that it is extremely difficult to make a
computer simulation of the motion of objects such as black holes when
they approach each other.

*Dan*: I'm happy to keep things simple, for now at least, and to stick
to Newton's classical mechanics.

*Carol*: So am I.

== Relative Coordinates

*Dan*: Okay, I got the picture.  Now where does the one-body representation
come in?

:figure: absolute_relative_vectors.eps 6cm absolute_relative_vectors
Construction of alternative coordinates <tex>$\bR$</tex> and
<tex>$\br$</tex> for the center of mass position and the relative
position of the two bodies, respectively.

*Erica*: It comes in through a clever coordinate transformation.
We can define the center of mass (often abbreviated as c.o.m.) position as

:equation:
\label{com}
\bR = {M_1\br_1 + M_2\br_2 \over M_1 + M_2}

and the relative position of the second particle with respect to the first
particle as

:equation:
\label{separation}
\br = \br_2 - \br_1

I have drawn them in fig. ref(absolute_relative_vectors) as
they are constructed from <tex>$\br_1, \br_2$</tex>.

*Dan*: Where does this equation come from, and what does it mean?

*Carol*: The center of mass is the mass weighted position of an extended
object.  We use that in computer graphics for computer games all the time.
One way to look at it is to ask yourself where you should support a rod
with two weights attached at the end.  If one of the weights is twice
as heavy as the other, it should be twice as far from the support point
as the other is, in order to balance the rod.

*Dan*: I see, that helps.  So with `mass weighted' you mean that I multiply
the position of each particle with its mass, so that more massive particles
have a larger vote, so to speak, in where the center of mass will be.

*Carol*: Yes, and then you have to divide by the total mass.  Already on
dimensonial grounds it is clear that you have to divide by a mass, to 
wind up with a result that has the dimension of length.  And in the equal
mass case, it is clear that the c.o.m. should be the average of the
two positions, the point right in between them.

:figure: relative_vectors.eps 6cm relative_vectors
Alternative coordinates <tex>$\bR$</tex> and <tex>$\br$</tex>.

*Dan*: Okay, so let us accept Eq. (ref(com)), which leads to
fig. ref(absolute_relative_vectors).  But now I'm confused about
something else.  Let us draw a figure that contains only the two
new vectors, <tex>$\bR, \br$</tex>, that define the alternative
coordinate system.  Here it is, fig. ref(relative_vectors).

Now here is what seems odd.
In fig. ref(absolute_vectors) the two vectors <tex>$\br_1, \br_2$</tex> start
at the same point, namely the origin.  But in
fig. ref(relative_vectors) only the c.o.m. vector
<tex>$\bR$</tex> starts in the origin, while the relative position vector
<tex>$\br$</tex> connecting the two particles does not.

In other words, the two coordinate systems do not seem to be compatible.

*Erica*: Good point.  It is true that the information contained in the
pair of vectors <tex>$\br_1, \br_2$</tex> is the same as the information
contained in the vector pair <tex>$\bR, \br$</tex>.  But in the first
case, both vectors appear in the same inertial coordinate system, while	
in the second case, only <tex>$\bR$</tex> is a vector in an inertial
coordinate system, while <tex>$\br$</tex> points to particle 2 within a
coordinate system anchored to particle 1, which is certainly not inertial.

:figure: com_vector.eps 6cm com_vector
The vector <tex>$\bR$</tex> in the inertial coordinate system

:figure: separation_vector.eps 6cm separation_vector
The vector <tex>$\br$</tex> in a non-inertial coordinate system

*Dan*: So the vectors <tex>$\br_1, \br_2, \bR$</tex> are all defined in the
same original inertial coordinate system, while <tex>$\br$</tex> is defined
in a different coordinate system, which is not inertial.  Let me make that
clear, and draw two new figures.  Figure ref(com_vector) shows the c.o.m.
vector in the original coordinate frame, while figure ref(separation_vector)
shows the relative separation vector in a different frame, anchored on
particle 1, as you just explained.

*Erica*: Yes, that is a nice way to split it out.

== Coordinates

*Dan*: But I'm still confused.  You started talking
about a change from absolute to relative coordinates.  But in fact we
seem to switch from two vectors in an absolute inertial coordinate
system to two other vectors, one in the old coordinate system and one
in a new, non-inertial coordinate system.  What is going on?

*Erica*: I guess the notation and terminology in physics is rather sloppy.
We generally don't try to be logically precise, the way mathematicians are.
But I'm glad you're forcing us to be clear about our terms.  It helps
me, too, to build things up again from scratch.

It seems that there are two ways to use the notion of coordinates.
But let me first summarize what we have learned.

We have, so far, dealt with two coordinate frames.  We have the
inertial one, centered on an arbitrary point, a point that is either
at rest or in uniform motion with respect to absolute space.  The
coordinate axes point in fixed directions with respect to absolute
space.  And we also have the non-inertial frame, centered on particle 1.
And although this frame is non-inertial, because particle 1 feels
the force of particle 2 and therefore does not move in a straight line
at constant speed, the coordinate axes of the non-inertial coordinate
system remain parallel to the coordinate axes of the inertial
coordinate system.

This last point is important.  When the two particles complete one
orbit around each other, the relative vector <tex>$\br$</tex> will
also complete one orbit in the non-inertial coordinate system given
in fig. ref(separation_vector).

Now here are the two ways that physicists use `coordinates', at least
as I understand it.  The first way is to give the coordinates of vectors
with respect to the coordinate frame in which they are defined.  In that
case, we have already dealt with the coordinates of the four vectors
<tex>$\br_1, \br_2, \bR, \br$</tex>.  In each case, a single vector,
or equivalently the values of the components of that vector, decribe
the position of one particle with respect to a point in space.  For
example, <tex>$\br_2$</tex> describes the poition of particle 2 with
respect to the origin, and <tex>$\br$</tex> describes the poition of
particle 2 with respect to the point in space temporarily occupied by
particle 1.

The second way is to talk about coordinates is to capture the information
about a whole system, not only about a single particle with respect to
a point in space.  We can say that we have described a two-body
configuration completely when we give the information contained in the 
pair of vectors <tex>$\br_1, \br_2$</tex>, or equivalently, in the values
of their four components in two dimensions, or their six components in
three dimensions.  But we can also describe the same two-body configuration
completely by giving the information contained in the pair of vectors
<tex>$\bR, \br$</tex>.

So in the second way of speaking, a coordinate transformation means a
change between describing the two-body system through specifying
<tex>$\br_1, \br_2$</tex> and describing the same system through
specifying <tex>$\bR, \br$</tex>.

In the beginning of our session, I used the second way of speaking.
But then, when we started talking about coordinate systems, I guess
I slipped into the first way of speaking.

*Dan*: Thanks for separating those two ways of speaking.  I'll have to
go over it a few times more, to get fluent in this way of thinking,
but I'm beginning to see the light.

*Carol*: Now the beautiful thing is: it <i>is</i> possible to use the
same language for both ways of speaking.  This is something else I
learned in our `computer game' class as we called it, although it was
really titled as a `geometrical representation' class.  If a single
vector lives in a $d$-dimensional space, then a system of two such
vectors can also be represented as a single vector in a $2d$-dimensional
space.  And then your second way of speaking with respect to the
$d$-dimensional space boils down to your first way of speaking with
respect to the $2d$-dimensional space.

Mathematically speaking, each choice of a set of two vectors, whether
it is <tex>$\{\br_1,\br_2\}$</tex> or <tex>$\{\bR,\br\}$</tex>,
determines a single point in the direct product of two copies of the
base space in which the single vectors live.  In our case, we have
started from two-dimensional vectors, so the space for pairs of
vectors is four-dimensional.  And the coordinate transformation that
Erica has introduced is really a bijective mapping between two
four-dimensional spaces.

*Dan*: Just when I thought I understood something, Carol manages to
make it sound all gobbledygook again.  I'll just stick with Erica's
explanation.

== Equivalent coordinates

*Carol*: Well, I have one question left.  I mentioned that the
transformation between the <tex>$\{\br_1,\br_2\}$</tex> coordinate system
and the <tex>$\{\bR,\br\}$</tex> was bijective.  What that means is
that any pair <tex>$\{\br_1,\br_2\}$</tex> corresponds
to a unique pair <tex>$\{\bR,\br\}$</tex>, and vice versa.

I think that is true, but I would like to prove it, to make sure, and
to see explicitly which pair of <tex>$\{\br_1,\br_2\}$</tex> corresponds
to which pair of <tex>$\{\bR,\br\}$</tex> vectors.

*Dan*: Good questions!  Erica has
shown how to derive <tex>$\bR$</tex> and <tex>$\br$</tex> from
<tex>$\br_1$</tex> and <tex>$\br_2$</tex>, with the definitions above.
But when we are given only <tex>$\bR$</tex> and <tex>$\br$</tex>, can we
then really recover the original <tex>$\br_1$</tex> and <tex>$\br_2$</tex>?

*Erica*: Yes, we can, or at least I'm pretty sure we can.  But we'll have
to scratch our heads a bit to write it down.  Let us start with figure
ref(absolute_relative_vectors).  We can use the same figure, but now we
should consider <tex>$\bR$</tex> and <tex>$\br$</tex> as given, and the
question is how to derive the values for <tex>$\br_1$</tex> and
<tex>$\br_2$</tex>.

When I took my classical mechanics course, many homework questions
were of this type, and generally they involved a clever form of
coordinate transformation.  Hmmm.  Let's see.  Right now the origin
is at an arbitrary point in space.  We could shift to a coordinate
frame that is centered on one of our three special points; the position of
particle 1, the position of particle 2, or the position of the c.o.m.

Well, why not start with particle 1, and see what happens.  Let me draw
the new coordinate frame, using primed symbols: <tex>$x'$</tex> and
<tex>$y'$</tex> instead of <tex>$x$</tex> and <tex>$y$</tex> for the
coordinate axes.

:figure: new_absolute_relative_vectors.eps 6cm new_absolute_relative_vectors
A shift of coordinate frame brings the origin to the position of particle 1.
In this new frame, the c.o.m. vector is <tex>$\bR'$</tex>.

*Carol*: Ah, I see, that is a great move, really!  In this new coordinate
system, the c.o.m. position is given by the vector <tex>$\bR'$</tex>,
pointing from the position of particle 1 to the c.o.m.  This means that
we can reconstruct <tex>$\br_1$</tex> as the sum of <tex>$\bR$</tex> and
<tex>$-\bR'$</tex>!

*Dan*: Wait a minute, not so quick.  I don't see that yet.  Let me try
to take smaller steps.  The vector <tex>$-\bR'$</tex> must point, by
definition, in the opposite direction of <tex>$\bR'$</tex>.  So you can
go from the old origin to <tex>$\br_1$</tex> by first following the
vector <tex>$\bR$</tex> from start till tip, and then following the
vector <tex>$-\bR'$</tex>, which conveniently starts at the tip
of <tex>$\bR$</tex>.  And the tip of <tex>$-\bR'$</tex> lands on particle 1.

So far so good.  And this means that we have
<tex>$\br_1 = \bR + (-\bR')$</tex>, or in simpler
terms

:equation:
\label{R_minus_R_prime}
\br_1 = \bR - \bR'

Fine!  But how do we compute this vector <tex>$-R'$</tex>?

*Carol*: Elementary, my dear Watson.  In the old coordinate frame, we
had Eq. (ref(com)) which gave us the position vector of the c.o.m. in
that frame.  Let's write it again:

:equation:
\label{com_again}
\bR = {M_1\br_1 + M_2\br_2 \over M_1 + M_2}

This expression is valid in any coordinate frame, so we can use it for
the new primed coordinate frame as well.  In the new frame,
<tex>$r'_1=0$</tex> because the new origin lies smack on the first particle,
so that particle has distance zero to the new origin.  And the
position vector of the second particle is given as
<tex>$r_2' = r_2 - r_1 = r$</tex>.
Erica, your choice of coordinate frame shifting was brilliant!  We have
in the new frame:

:equation:
\label{com_prime}
\bR' = {M_1\br'_1 + M_2\br'_2 \over M_1 + M_2} = 
{M_1 0 + M_2 \br \over M_1 + M_2} = 
{M_2\over M_1 + M_2}\br

If we now use Eq.(ref(R_minus_R_prime)) that Dan just derived, 
and substitute the value of <tex>$\bR'$</tex> that we found in
Eq.(ref(com_prime)), we get:

:equation:
\label{br1}
\br_1 = \bR - {M_2 \over M_1 + M_2} \br

== xxxxxxx

<b>This is how far I got, 2007/4/14</b>

== xxxxxxx

*Carol*: And the second particle's position is obtained simply by	
interchaning the subscripts 1 and 2 everywhere, right?

*Erica*: Wrong, but almost right: there is an additional sign change:

:equation:
\br_2 = \bR + {M_1 \over M_1 + M_2} \br

*Carol*: Ah yes, that makes sense, since there was a minus sign in the
original definition of <tex>$\br$</tex>.  And in fact the whole picture
makes sense now: when the first particle is much more massive
than the second particle, <tex>$\bR$</tex> almost coincides with
<tex>$\br_1$</tex>, while the much lighter particle <tex>$\br_2$</tex>
finds itself at a distance of almost <tex>$\br$</tex> from the c.o.m.
<tex>$\bR$</tex>.

*Dan*: Even so, I do like hard evidence!  As you already saw, it is all
too easy to get replace a plus sign with a minus sign and those types of
things, and we'd better get things really right.  Let me try to prove what
Erica just wrote down.  I will take Eq. (ref(br1)) and then use the original
definitions Eqs. (ref(com)) and (ref(separation)):

:eqnarray:
\br_1 &=& \bR - {M_2 \over M_1 + M_2} \br                \nonumber \\
&=& {M_1\br_1 + M_2\br_2 \over M_1 + M_2}
- {M_2 \over M_1 + M_2} \left( \br_2 - \br_1 \right)     \nonumber \\
&=& {M_1 + M_2 \over M_1 + M_2} \br_1
+ {M_2 - M_2 \over M_1 + M_2} \br_2            \nonumber \\
&=& \br_1

Yes, now I am convinced.  And I can already see more or less how it works
for <tex>$\br_2$</tex>.  But, to be really sure, I'd like to finish
the job:

:eqnarray:
\br_2 &=& \bR + {M_1 \over M_1 + M_2} \br                \nonumber \\
&=& {M_1\br_1 + M_2\br_2 \over M_1 + M_2}
+ {M_1 \over M_1 + M_2} \left( \br_2 - \br_1 \right)     \nonumber \\
&=& {M_1 - M_1 \over M_1 + M_2} \br_1
+ {M_2 + M_1 \over M_1 + M_2} \br_2            \nonumber \\
&=& \br_2

*Carol*: That's nice, to see the truth in front of us, and to see
explicitly the correction of my initial sign mistake.

== Newton's Equations of Motion

*Erica*: Now that we are getting comfortable with our new coordinate
system, let us rewrite Newton's equations of motion into the new system.

*Dan*: Not so fast!  We haven't written the equations in our old system
yet.  You may be doing that every day, but I can barely remember what
I learned about classical mechanics.  Let us start from scratch.

*Erica*: Okay, you're right.  Well, here is the equation for the
acceleration of the first particle, due to the gravitational force
that the second particle exerts on it:

:equation:
\label{Newton_r1}
\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\br_1 = G \frac{M_2}{r^3}\br

Here I have used the abbreviation

:equation:
r = |\br|

This is a second-order differential equation.  At the left-hand side
you see the second derivative of position with respect to time
<tex>$t$</tex>.  The first time derivative of position
<tex>$\br_1$</tex> is the velocity <tex>$\bv_1 = d\br_1 /dt$</tex>
for particle number 1, while the second derivative presented here is
the acceleration <tex>$\ba_1 = d\bv_1 /dt = d^2\br_1 /dt^2 $</tex>.
At the right hand side, <tex>$M_2$</tex> indicates the mass of the
second particles.  As you can guess, <tex>$M_1$</tex> would be the
mass of the first particle, and <tex>$\bv_2$</tex> and <tex>$\ba_2$</tex>
stand for the velocity and acceleration of the second particle.
Finally, <tex>$G$</tex> is the value of Newton's gravitational constant.

I'm glad you both have at least some familiarity with differential
equations.  It may not be a bad idea to brush up your knowledge, if
you want to know more about the background of Newtonian gravity.
There are certainly plenty of good introductory books.  At this point
it is not necessary, though, to go deeply into all that.  I can just
provide the few equations we need to get started, and for quite a
while our main challenge will be to figure out how to solve these
equations.

*Dan*: Glad to hear that!  But I'm puzzled about one thing.  Why is
there a third power in the denominator?  I thought that
gravity shows an inverse square attraction, not an inverse cube!

*Erica*: Yes, the magnitude of the acceleration is indeed proportional
to the minus second power of the separation.  However, we also need to
indicate the direction of the acceleration.  We can define a unit
vector <tex>$\hat\br$</tex> pointing in the direction of the second
particle, as seen from the position of the first particle:

:equation:
\hat\br = {\br \over r}

Using this unit vector, we can rewrite Eq. (ref(Newton_r1)) as:

:equation:
\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\br_1 = G \frac{M_2}{r^2}\hat\br

*Dan*: I see.  So the magnitude is indeed inverse square, but the direction
is given by the unit vector, which has length one, and therefor does not
influence the length of the acceleration vector.  I like this way of writing
better, since it brings out the physics more clearly.

*Carol*: I guess that Erica wrote it in the form of Eq. (ref(Newton_r1))
because it will be easier to program that way.

*Erica*: Indeed.  Once you get used to this way of writing the equations
of motion, there is no need to introduce the new quantity <tex>$\hat\br$</tex>,
since it is not used anywhere separately.

Let me also write the acceleration for the second particle:

:equation:
\label{Newton_r2}
\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\br_2 = - G \frac{M_1}{r^3}\br

*Carol*: This time I noticed the sign change: the force of attraction
exerted by the first particle on the second points toward the first
particle.

*Dan*: Hmm, I'm still a bit confused about these signs.  When the force
points to the first particle, why does that imply a minus sign?

*Carol*: The easiest way to see this is to take a particular case.  Imagine
that the second particle is positioned in the origin of the coordinates.
Since gravity pulls particle 2 in the direction of particle 1, the
acceleration that particle 2 experiences points in the direction of
<tex>$\br_1$</tex>.  Notice that in this particular case
<tex>$\br = \br_2 - \br_1 = - \br_1$</tex>.  Therefore, the direction
<tex>$\br_1$</tex> is the opposite of the direction of <tex>$\br$</tex>,
hence the minus sign.

*Dan*: Ah, that is neat.  Instead of trying to figure things out in
full generality, you take a particular limiting case, and check the
sign.  Since you already know the magnitude and the line along which
the acceleration is directed, once you know the sign in one case,
you know the sign in all cases.

*Carol*: Yes.  Technically we call this invariance under continuous
deformation.  If you bring the second particle a little bit out of the
origin, by small continuous changes, the acceleration between the
particles much change continuously as well; it cannot suddenly flip
to the opposite direction.

*Erica*: Neat indeed: this means that understanding the sign in one
place let you know the sign in all places.  I'll remember using that
trick.

Okay, onward with the equations of motion.  Given Eqs.(ref(Newton_r1))
and (ref(Newton_r2)), we can calculate the accelerations for the
alternative coordinates by using the defining equations (ref(com)) and
(ref(separation)), as follows.

:eqnarray:
\label{Newton_com}
\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\bR
&=&
{M_1\over M_1 + M_2}\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\br_1 +
{M_2\over M_1 + M_2}\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\br_2                     \nonumber \\
&=&
{M_1\over M_1 + M_2}\left(G \frac{M_2}{r^3}\br\right) +

== An Equivalent 1-Body Problem

*Dan*: The second equation looks like a form of Newton's law of gravity,
but what does it mean that the first equation gives just zero as an answer?

*Carol*: Well, it seems that there is zero acceleration for the position
of the center of mass.

*Dan*: Ah, so the c.o.m. moves with constant velocity?

*Erica*: Yes, and this means that we can choose an inertial coordinate
frame that moves along with the c.o.m., and in that coordinate frame
the center of mass does not move at all.  And to make it really simple,
we can choose a coordinate frame where the c.o.m. is located at the
origin of the coordinates.

*Dan*: That does make life simple.  In this coordinate frame, all the
information about the motions in the two-body problem is now bundled
Eq. (ref(Newton_separation)).  It almost looks as if we are dealing
with a 1-body problem, instead of a 2-body problem!

 NOTfigure: com_vector.eps 6cm com_vector
 The vector <tex>$\bR$</tex> in its own space.

 NOTfigure: separation_vector.eps 6cm separation_vector
 The vector <tex>$\br$</tex> in its own space.

*Erica*: Yes, this is what I meant when I announced that we could map
the two-body problem into an equivalent one-body problem, for any choice
of the masses.  The original equations (ref(Newton_r1)) and (ref(Newton_r2))
are coupled: both <tex>$\br_1$</tex> and <tex>$\br_2$</tex> occur in both
equations, indirectly through the fact that <tex>$\br = \br_2-\br1$</tex>.
In contrast, the equations (ref(Newton_com)) and (ref(Newton_separation)) are
decoupled.

A clear way to show this is to draw to separate figures,
Figs. ref(com_vector) and ref(separation_vector).  The c.o.m. vector
in Fig. ref(com_vector) moves in a way that is totally independent of
the way the relative vector in ref(separation_vector) moves.  The
c.o.m. vector moves at a constant speed, while the relative vector
moves as if it follows an abstract particle in a gravitational field.

To see this, notice that Eq. (ref(Newton_separation)) is _exactly_ Newton's
equation for the gravitational acceleration of a body that feels the
attraction of a hypothetical body of mass <tex>$M_1 + M_2$</tex>.  To check
this, look at Eq. (ref(br1)), and replace <tex>$\br_1$</tex> by
<tex>$\br$</tex> and replace <tex>$M_2$</tex> by <tex>$M_1+M_2$</tex>.

*Dan*: Indeed.  So the relative motion between two bodies can be described
as if it was the motion of just one body under the gravitational attraction
of another body, that happens to have a mass equal to the sum of the masses
of the two original bodies.

*Erica*: Exactly.  And to complete this particular picture, we have to
make sure that the other body stays in the origin, at the place of the
center of mass.  We can do this by giving our alternative body a mass
zero.  In other words, we consider the motion of a massless test particle
under the influence of the gravitational field of a body with mass 
<tex>$M_1 + M_2$</tex>, that is located in the center of the coordinate
system.

*Carol*: I see.  Because the testparticle has zero mass, it exerts zero
gravitational pull on the central body.  Therefore, the central body
does not move at all, and the only task we are left with is to determine
the motion of the test particle around the center.

*Dan*: And that is a one-body problem.  How neat!

== Wrapping Up

*Carol*: Let us gather the formulas we have obtained so far, for our
coordinate transformation, from absolute to relative coordinates.

:equation:
\label{br1_br2}
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
\br_1 = \bR - {\displaystyle {M_2 \over M_1 + M_2}} \br                   \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
\br_2 = \bR + {\displaystyle {M_1 \over M_1 + M_2}} \br
\end{array} \right.

:equation:
\label{com_separation}
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
\bR = {\displaystyle {M_1\br_1 + M_2\br_2 \over M_1 + M_2}}                 \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
\br = \br_2 - \br_1
\end{array} \right.

:equation:
\label{Newton_br1_br2}
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
{\displaystyle {d^2 \over dt^2}}\br_1 = 
G {\displaystyle {M_2 \over r^3}}\br      \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
{\displaystyle {\frac{d^2}{dt^2}}}\br_2 =
- G {\displaystyle {\frac{M_1}{r^3}}}\br
\end{array} \right.

:equation:
\label{Newton_com_separation}
\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
{\displaystyle\frac{d^2}{dt^2}}\bR = 0                                     \\
\phantom{1}&\phantom{1}&\phantom{1} \\
{\displaystyle\frac{d^2}{dt^2}}\br = - G {\displaystyle\frac{M_1+M_2}{r^3}}\br
\end{array} \right.

*Dan*: So from all these equations, what we are going to solve with our
computer program is the last one above, right?

*Erica*: Yes, and let me write the equation once again here:

:equation:
\label{Newton2body}
\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\br = - G \frac{M_1 + M_2}{r^3}\br

And there is one more thing: let's make life as simple as we can, by
choosing a system of physical units in which the gravitational
constant and the total mass of the 2-body system are both unity:

:eqnarray:
G & = & 1                      \nonumber \\
M_1 + M_2 & = & 1

Our original equation of motion now becomes simply:

:equation:
\label{Newton2bodysimple}
\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\br = - \frac{\br}{r^3}

*Dan*:
I can't imagine anything simpler than that!
Let's start coding.
