= Dense Stellar Systems

== Galactic Suburbia

The sun is a star like any other among the hundred billion or so stars
in our galaxy.  It is unremarkable in its properties.  Its mass is in
the mid range of what is normal for stars: there are others more than
ten times more massive, and there are also stars more then ten times less
massive, but the vast majority of stars have a mass within a factor
ten of that of the sun.  Our home star is also unremarkable in its
location, at a distance of some thirty thousand light years from the
center of the galaxy.  Again, the number of stars closer to the center
and further away from the center are comparable.  Our closest neighbor,
Proxima Centauri, lies at a distance of a bit more than four light years.

This distance is typical for separations between stars in our neck of
the woods.  A light year is ten million times larger than the diameter
of the sun (a million km, or three light seconds).  In a scale model,
if we would represent each star as a cherry, an inch across, the
separation between the stars would be many hundreds of miles.  It is
clear from these numbers that collisions between stars in the solar
neighborhood must be very rare.  Although the stars follow random
orbits without any traffic control, they present such tiny targets
that we have to wait very long indeed in order to witness two of them
crashing into each other.  A quick estimate tells us that the sun has
a chance of hitting another star of less than <tex>$10^{-18}$</tex> per year.  In
other words, we would have to wait at least <tex>$10^{18}$</tex> years to have an
appreciable chance to witness such a collision.  Given that the sun is
less than five billion years old, it is no surprise that it does not
show any signs of a past collision: the chance that that would have
happened was less than one in a hundred million.  Life in our galactic
suburbs is really quite safe for a star.

There are other places in our galaxy that are far more crowded, and
consequently are a lot more dangerous to venture into.  We will have
a brief look at four types of crowded neighborhoods.

A snapshot of the globular cluster M15, taken with the Hubble Space
Telescope.

In the photo above we see a picture of the globular cluster M15,
taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.  This cluster contains roughly
a million stars.  In the central region typical distances between
neighboring stars are only a few hundredth of a light year, more than
a hundred times smaller than those in the solar neighborhood.  This
implies a stellar density that is more than a million times larger
than that near the sun.  Since the typical relative velocities of
stars in M15 are comparable to that of the sun and its neighbors, a
few tens of km/sec, collision times scale with the density, leading to
a central time between collisions of less than <tex>$10^{12}$</tex> years.  With
globular clusters having an age of more than <tex>$10^{10}$</tex> years, a typical
star near the center already has a chance of more than a percent to
have undergone a collision in the past.  

In fact, the chances are much higher than this rough estimate indicates.
One reason is the stars spend some part of their life time in a much
more extended state.  A star like the sun increases its diameter by
more than a factor of one hundred toward the end of its life, when
they become a red giant.  By presenting a much larger target to other
stars, they increase their chance for a collision during this stage
(even though this increase is partly offset by the fact that the red
giant stage lasts shorter than the so-called main-sequence life time
of a star, during which they have a normal appearance and diameter).
The other reason is that many stars are part of a double star system,
a type of dynamic spider web that can catch a third star, or another
double star, into a temporary three- or four-body dance.  Once engaged
in such a dance, the local stellar crowding is enormously enhanced,
and the chance for collisions is greatly increased. 

A detailed analysis of all these factors predicts that a significant
fraction of stars in the core of a dense globular cluster such as M15
has already undergone at least one collision in its life time.  This
analysis, however, is quiet complex.  To study all of the important
channels through which collisions may occur, we have to analyze
encounters between a great variety of single and double stars, and
occasional bound triples and larger bound multiples of stars.  Since
each star in a bound subsystem can be a normal main-sequence star, a
red giant, a white dwarf, a neutron star or even a black hole, as well
as an exotic collision product itself, the combinatorial richness of
flavors of double stars and triples is enormous.  If we want to pick a
particular double star, we not only have to choose a star type for
each of its members, but in addition we have to specify the mass of
each star, and the parameters of its orbit, such as the semi-major axis
(a measure for the typical separation of the two stars) as well as the
orbital eccentricity.

The goal of our book series is to develop the software tools to make
it possible to simulate an entire star cluster like M15, and to
analyze the resulting behavior both locally and globally.


== Galactic Nuclei

In photo below we see an image of the very center of our galaxy.
This picture is taken with the Northern branch of the two Gemini
telescopes, which is located in Hawaii on top of the mountain Mauna Kea.

North telescope.  The center is located on the right just above the
bottom edge of the image.

In the very center of our galaxy, a black hole resides with a mass
a few million times larger than the mass of our sun.  Although the
black hole itself is invisible, we can infer its presence by its
strong gravitational field, which in turn is reflected in the speed
with which stars pass near the black hole.  In normal visible light it
is impossible to get a glimpse of the galactic center, because of the
obscuring gas clouds that are positioned between us and the center.
Infrared light, however, can penetrate deeper in dusty regions.
It is a false-color image, reconstructed from
observations in different infrared wavelength bands.

In the central few light years near the black hole, the total mass of
stars is comparable to the mass of the hole.  This region is also
called the galactic nucleus.  Here the stellar density is at least as
large as that in the center of the densest globular clusters.  However,
due to the strong attraction of the black hole, the stars zip around at
much higher velocities.  Whereas a typical star in the core of M15 has
a speed of a few tens of km/sec, stars near the black hole in the
center of our galaxy move with speeds exceeding a 1000 km/sec.  As a
consequence, the frequency of stellar collisions is strongly enhanced.

Modeling the detailed behavior of stars in this region remains a great
challenge, partly because of the complicated environmental features.
A globular cluster forms a theorist's dream of a laboratory, with its
absence of gas and dust and star forming regions.  All we find there
are stars that can be modeled well as point particles unless they come
close and collide, after which we can apply the point particle
approximation once again.  In contrast, there are giant molecular
clouds containing enormous amounts of gas and dust right close up to
the galactic center.  In these clouds, new stars are formed, some of
which will soon afterwards end their life in brilliant supernova
explosions, while spewing much of their debris back into the
interstellar medium.  Such complications are not present in globular
clusters, where supernovae no longer occur since the member stars are
too old and small to become a supernova.

Most other galaxies also harbor a massive black hole in their nuclei.
Some of those have a mass of hundreds of millions of solar masses, or
in extreme cases even more than a billion times the mass of the sun.
The holy grail of the study of dense stellar systems is to perform and
analyze accurate simulations of the complex ecology of stars and gas
in the environment of such enormous holes in space.  Much of the
research on globular clusters can be seen as providing the initial
steps toward a detailed modeling of galactic nuclei.

== Star Forming Regions

link:orion.jpg

There are many other places in the galactic disk where the density of
stars is high enough to make collisions likely, at least temporarily.
These are the sites where stars are born.  The above photo taken
by the Japanese Subaru telescope in Hawaii shows the Orion Nebula,
also known as M42, at a distance of 1500 light years from the sun.
This picture, too, is taking in infrared light in order to penetrate
the dusty regions surrounding the young stars.  The four brightest
stars in the center, collectively known as the Trapezium, form the
most massive stars of a larger conglomeration of stars, all recently
formed from the gas and dust that still surrounds them.

In order to study collisions in these star forming regions, we can no
longer treat the stars as point masses.  Many of the collisions take
place while the stars are still in the process of forming.  While a
protostar is still in the process of contracting from the gas cloud
in which it was born, it presents a larger target for collisions with
other stars.  In addition, a single contracting gas cloud may fission,
giving rise to more than one star at the same time.  In this way, the
correlated appearance of protostars is even more likely to lead to
subsequent collisions.

The proper way to model these processes is to combine gas dynamics and
stellar dynamics.  Much progress has been made recently in this area.
One way to use stellar dynamics in an approximate fashion is to begin
with the output of the gas dynamics codes, which present the positions
and velocities of a group of newly formed stars, and then to follow
and analyze the motions of those stars, including their collisions.

== Open Clusters

Although stars are formed in groups, these groups typically do not
stay together for very long.  Perturbations from other stars and gas
clouds in their vicinity are often enough to break up the fragile
gravitational hold they initially have over each other.  Some of the
more massive groups of newly formed stars, however, are sufficiently
tightly bound to survive their environmental harassment.  They form
the so-called open clusters, where their name indicates that they have
central densities that are typically less than what we see in globular
clusters.

The open star cluster M67, in a picture taken by the Anglo-Australian
Observatory.



The above photo shows one of the richest and densest open clusters,
M67, as observed by the Anglo-Australian Observatory.  Since this
cluster is old enough to have lost its gas and dust, all stars are
visible at normal optical wavelengths, at which this image is taken.
In the central regions of this cluster, there are indications that
some of the stars have undergone close encounters or even collisions.
Consequently, this star cluster qualifies as a dense stellar system.

Open clusters typically have fewer members than globular clusters.
Also, they are younger.  Both facts makes it easier to simulate open
clusters than globular clusters.  On the other hand, the densest
globular clusters show a higher frequency and a far richer variety of
stellar collisions, making them a more interesting laboratory.  In
that sense, a dynamical simulation of an open cluster can be seen as
providing preparatory steps toward the modeling of globular clusters,
just as a study of the latter forms a stepping stone toward the
investigation of galactic nuclei.
