= A Two-Step Method

== xxx

Start with <tt>yo6body.rb</tt>

First replace +nsteps+ by an instance variable <tt>@nsteps</tt>,
since it will be used for starting up the multistep method.

Call this <tt>ms2body.rb</tt>.

Extend <tt>vector.rb</tt> to allow "-" and why not "/" as well for
good measure.

 :commandoutput: ruby integrator_driver4a.rb < euler.in

 :commandoutput: ruby integrator_driver4b.rb < euler.in

looks like 2nd order  

 :commandoutput: ruby integrator_driver4c.rb < euler.in

Even better; clearly 2nd order
