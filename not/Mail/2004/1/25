I just did.

By the way, this points to the following lines in "acsdoc.rb" :

  if s =~ /:in.*code:/ and s.index("\":inccode:\"")==nil
    s.sub!(/:in.*code:/, ':include:')

Can you remind me why you added the s.index part?  Is that for the
case that someone wants to escape the inccode directive, for example,
when writing about it in a book?  If so, shouldn't it be:

  if s =~ /:in.*code:/ and s.index("\":in.*code:\"")==nil

with the .* in the second place there as well?

Yes, I think that would be better.  It is always better to actually
see an example, that to see the *description* of an example, which is
clear for the writer but not always for the reader.

But wait, there are two levels of meta here.  Right now, the rdoc
output gives:

  Anyway, here is a sample inline image: 

ignoring what was written in the README file, namely:

  Anyway, here is a sample inline image: 

  link:sample.gif

I guess what we really need is 1) a small gif file (acs logo would be nice!)
and 2) a way to escape the "link:sample.gif" statement so that we can
include that in the rdoc output *without* it being translated by acsdoc.

By the way, it is confusing to have a README file and a README.cp file,
with the same text.  I'm not sure what to do.  People expect a README
file, not a README.cp file.  One possibility would be to extent our
acsdoc script to look not only for .cp files but also for a README file;
but that could be too dangerous?

Now acsdoc.rb automatically creates these files, and sample directives
are in that file itself. So you can try things immedietly. Please try
ruby acsdoc.rb README.cp acsdoc.rb at ACSROOT/src/co*ng and check the
result.

Very nice.  Thanks a lot!

Here, too, it might be better to show the whole code as well, to show
the effect of what just happened there, but perhaps we can postpone
this to the book chapter that discusses all this; otherwise the README
file would get too long.  (If we want to include more, we could give a
second directive, picking out the small I/O part).

Not really ;>).  sumimasen.  In directory not/P/2003/11/images there
are two files to be included, currently in ps format:

  labnote-031111.eps
  labnote-031112.eps

However, I presume that we have to go to the original files

  labnote-031111.obj
  labnote-031112.obj

and produce from them .gif files.  By now it is long enough ago that I
have forgotten the name of the program that produced the .obj files,
so I don't know how to make the .gif files.

However, I just did everything else that is needed.  In the file
"labnotes031111" I replaced the original line

   \fig{labnote-031111.eps, 15 cm}

by the following new text

    # comment, added 2004/1/2:
    # originally we had here:
    # \fig{labnote-031111.eps, 15 cm}
    # but we have now replaced this with our current mechanism
    # used to include the following figure:
   
   link:images/labnote-031111.gif

And in the second file, "labnotes031112", it turns out that we had
completely forgotten to reference that figure!  So I added the
following lines:

   By the way, here is the improved version of yesterday's figure.

   link:images/labnote-031112.gif

So all we need now is to produce those two .gif files from the .obj
files.

Thanks!

Piet
