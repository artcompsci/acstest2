  Having access to the source code is one thing.
  Having access to the tacit knowledge that went into the process of
  writing the source code is quite something else.  In our <i>Manifesto</i>
  below, we describe the philosophy behind the ACS initiative.

  title: Open knowledge, a way to fully document open source
  description: |
    The know-how needed to construct a computational laboratory is largely
    a form of oral knowledge, known to a small group of practitioners, but
    not written down explicitly anywhere.  We have started the <i>The Art
    of Computational Science (ACS)</i> series with the aim of making explicit
    the implicit knowledge of experts of scientific simulations.  In addition
    to make our codes freely available as open source, we provide what we call
    <i>open knowledge</i>, in the form of detailed background information.
