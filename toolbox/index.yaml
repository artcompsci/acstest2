intro: |
  The ACS Toolbox is a collection of software tools, useful for
  large-scale simulations in any area of computational science.
  <p>
  These tools were developed within the context of the
  <a href="../kali/index.html">Maya project</a>, but they are presented
  here as a standalone package.  In order to use these tools,
  the user does not need to know anything about the Maya project
  (this is our goal; the full decoupling from Maya will probably take
  place in 2007).
  <p>
  Currently, the ACS toolbox contains the following six tool modules:
  <ul>
  <li>
  <a href=acsdoc/index.html>Acsdoc: The ACS document generation system</a>
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href=clop/index.html>Clop: a command line option parser</a>
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href=management/index.html>Code management:
  libraries, versions, and compatibility</a>
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href=acsio/index.html>ACS data format:
  self-describing data files
  </a>
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href=graphics/index.html>Figures: virtual plotting</a>
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href=visualization/index.html>Visualization: acsvis</a>
  </li>
  </ul>

    The ACS Toolbox: A Collection of Project-Independent Tools
  description: |
    The ACS Toolbox is a collection of tools that have beeen developed
    in specific projects under the ACS umbrella, but that can be used
    in a much more general way for many other projects as well.  While
    the development of each tool is described within the project where
    it was created, we present the toolbox here as a stand-alone Ruby
    code package.  The toolbox is modular, and most tools can be used
    in stand-alone mode; where there is a dependence of one tool on
    another, that dependence is clearly documented.
