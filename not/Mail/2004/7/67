Hi Jun:

I am writing this in the airplane back to New York.
I'm making a large inventory of all the points that
we need to take care of, at some point during the
coming few months.  However, I will ask only a few
questions now; I will leave the rest for Aug/Sept.

In the last two emails to our lab notes, on June 28
and July 1, we discussed how to make cross links
between different volumes and also between the html
pages and the volumes.  I have thought about the
options you mentioned, and here is my response:

Sumimasen.  However, this time I *think* we can stay with the
volume numbering of ACS 1.1.  I like the logic: One vision
volume, four start-up volumes, seven foundation volumes, and
then many research volumes.

Of course, we *could* decide to use indirect addressing:
for example, we could address the Plummer volume with a
logical name "Plummer" or "vol-acs11-5" to indicate that
during acs-1.1 it was called volume 5.  I would be happy
with either choice: hard-wired "vol-5" and indirect
addressing.  Do you have a preference?

I do not like so much the idea of a global name space for all volumes,
since later we may get 100 volumes.  On the other hand, perhaps this
is the best solution.  Of course, we could use a label such as:
"vol-acs11-5-binney-tremaine-appendix-chapter-section-bob-unhappy".
Surely such a label will never be used elsewhere in the book, or at
least it will be extremely unlikely.

Another option would be to give a logical name (label) to each volume,
and to each chapter, and to each section.  But perhaps that would be
more work.  It would be a very Ruby-like approach though, using such
indirect addressing.  Again, I do not have a strong preference.
What do you think?

See above, my example of very-long-label.

Perhaps this would be an argument for giving all books a logical
name, and also each chapter and each section.  We could then 
`compile', I mean Latex, all .ok files of acs in one big pass,
but that might be too huge a job.  However, I see no other way to
get all the references consistent.  This is a very difficult point.


Now let me switch to the last "not" lab note email message, of July 1:

I suggest that we first implement this, perhaps already for ACS 1.1.1
or otherwise for ACS 1.1.2 or so.  This is more straightforward.  As
for the other questions above, we can exchange a few more emails, and
if we don't converge quickly, we can leave a decision for late September.

I checked, and indeed, this doesn't work yet.  So whenever it is
convenient, it would be nice to add that feature to acsdoc.

Thanks!
