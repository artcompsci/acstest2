= Formula Translating

== A Body with Vectors

*Bob*: Okay, here is the next step.  We first have to tell our +Body+
class that the positions and velocities are no longer arrays, but
vectors.  Let me create a new file +vbody.rb+ for this modified class.
I will call the modified class +Body+ as well.  If we are happy with
it, we can discard the previous +Body+ class definition.

 :inccode: vbody1.rb

Here it is.  I have added one line and modified one line, that's all!
The line on top <tt>require "vector.rb"</tt> I have added so as to make
Ruby aware of our new class +Vector+; as we have seen, the Ruby interpreter
effectively replaces this line by the file <tt>vector.rb</tt>.  Now the only
thing I changed is the initialization line for +pos+ and +vel+.  They
are now <i>bona fide</i> vectors, right when they see the light of day.

The next step is to adapt our integrator, so that it can handle particles
with vectors for their positions and velocities.  Remember, that was the
whole reason for the exercise: to simplify the notation in our forward
Euler integrator.  You were unhappy with the <tt>|k|</tt> notation, and
that started us off on this long trek.

*Alice*: But we learned a lot on our journey.  Yes, I remember now.
I was complaining about component notation, and then you decided you
can give me real vector notation, without components.  Seems like a
while ago!

== Shrinking Code

*Bob*: But now we're getting close.  Let me rename the old file
<tt>euler1.rb</tt>, and then add vectors to <tt>euler2.rb</tt>.
No, let me be more careful.  Let me call it <tt>euler2a.rb</tt>, for
alpha version of <tt>euler2.rb</tt>.  If and when it works, we can
rename it <tt>euler2.rb</tt>.

*Alice*: You're getting cautious!  Can you remind me what
<tt>euler1.rb</tt> looked like?

*Bob*: Here it is, or was; or will be -- but not for much longer:

 :inccode: euler1.rb

All we have to do is to change the first +require+ line to require
+vbody.rb+ to be loaded instead of +body.rb+, and then we are free
to purge the +do+ loop from the obnoxious +k+ component notation.
Are you ready for this?

*Alice*: Sure thing!

*Bob*: Here it is.  One line shorter in total, which most of the
lines shorter in length as well:

 :inccode: euler2a.rb

== FORTRAN

*Alice*: One of these days you'll shorten it so much that you can hand
me a one-line integrator, just like you produced one-line read and write
functions, earlier!

*Bob*: Don't count on it; I think a five-line integrator is good enough
already.  What a difference with <tt>euler1.rb</tt>!  Instead of asking
<tt>b.pos</tt> to add the square of each of its components to
<tt>r2</tt>, after setting <tt>r2</tt> to zero, we simply order
<tt>r2</tt> to be the inner product of <tt>b.pos</tt> with itself, in
the first line of the +do+ loop.

The next line is unchanged.  But then the fun really starts: the
acceleration vector is now directly given as the product of the
velocity vector with the terms mass over distance cubed.

*Alice*: Just as we saw it in formula form earlier:

<tex>
\begin{equation}
{\bf a} = - \frac{M}{r^3}{\bf r}
\end{equation}
</tex>

*Bob*: So you see, now we can translate our formulas directly into
computer code!

*Alice*: Perhaps Ruby should be called FORmula TRANslator.

*Bob*: I'm afraid that name has already been taken, quite a few
decades ago . . .

*Alice*: And the next two lines clearly mean:

<tex>
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf r}_{i+1} & = & {\bf r}_i + {\bf v}_i dt     \nonumber \\
{\bf v}_{i+1} & = & {\bf v}_i + {\bf a}_i dt     \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
</tex>

also just like we wrote it before.  What a relief, to write a computer
code as if you write equations directly down into the software!

*Bob*: Indeed.  I've seen C++ doing that, what they call overloading
operators, and you can get a similar notation, but with far more work.

*Alice*: And with a complex class definition and declaration structure
that is very hard to play with and to change at will.  In contrast, here
with Ruby we can really do what they always advertise as rapid prototyping.

*Bob*: But before congratulating ourselves too much, let us first see
whether this now runs.  I've grown a bit more cautious after those
surprises we got earlier.  Ruby is certainly powerful, but as we have
seen, we'd better now what we are doing, in order to use all that power
wisely.

*Alice*: Well said, Bob!  Let's run the new version of the integrator
with the same values we had before, which I see you have still there in
the file <tt>euler2a.rb</tt>: a hundred time steps of 0.01 time units
each.

*Bob*: Here goes:

 :commandoutput: ruby euler2a.rb < euler.in

== An Old Friend

*Alice*: Where did we see that error message before?

*Bob*: I know, it is an old friend, isn't it?  I had hoped we had banned
it forever.  But at least we have an idea now where it could come from.
I bet that there is still a vector somewhere that somehow thinks it is
an array . . .

*Alice*: Which line is line 12 in <tt>euler2a.rb</tt>

*Bob*: it's the very first line in our +do+ loop.  Just a few lines above,
+b+ is freshly minted, so perhaps <tt>b.simple_read</tt> is the bad
influence that turns some vector into an array?  Could be.  But before
jumping to conclusions, let me sprinkle in a few +class+ statements.

*Alice*: You _are_ getting cautious!

*Bob*: Yeah, but I don't want to waste more time, this time around.
Let me do it in +irb+ directly, so that we can get everything echoed.

    |gravity> irb --prompt short_prompt -r vbody1.rb
    001:0> include Math
    Object
    002:0> dt = 0.01
    0.01
    003:0> ns = 100
    100
    004:0> b = Body.new
    #<Body:0x400cda40 @vel=[0, 0, 0], @pos=[0, 0, 0], @mass=0>
    005:0> b.class
    Body
    006:0> b.pos.class
    Vector
    007:0> b.simple_read

And now it hangs.  Hello, computer!?  What are you waiting for?

*Alice*: You haven't given it the <tt>euler.in</tt> input file.

*Bob*: Ah, of course.  I can see that there are drawbacks of using
an interactive interpreter if you're testing something that has
dependencies with other things.  Well, the file is short enough
to type in by hand.  Here goes:

    007:0> b.simple_read
    1
    1 0
    0 0.5
    [0.0, 0.5]
    008:0> b.pos.class
    Array

*Alice*: Our old friend, the vector-turned-array bug!  So you were
right, after all, suspecting that <tt>simple_read</tt> was the culprit.

*Bob*: What do you mean `after all'?  I was almost certain, but now
I know for sure.

== Magic

*Alice*: Right you are!  Now what is wrong with <tt>simple_read</tt>?

*Bob*: Let's inspect.  Here is the definition:

 :inccode: .vbody1.rb+simple_read

And, yes, it is obvious!  <tt>@pos</tt> receives its value from a
<tt>gets.split.map</tt> operation, in other words first +gets+ is
invoked to read a line, then the string method +split+ splits the 
string that +gets+ just returned, in the form of an array, and finally
+map+ does something on all the elements of that array, returning a
new array with the results.  And that last part is where the trouble
arises: +map+ returns an array that is assigned to <tt>@pos</tt>.

*Alice*: And poor <tt>@pos</tt>, Ruby chameleon that it is, instantly
degrades into an array, forgetting its whole rich vectorness.  Of course.
Well, when you get some more experience, debugging becomes a breeze,
doesn't it?

*Bob*: Ah, but then you start writing more complicated programs and
then you run into more subtle bugs.  It's like an arms race.

*Alice*: We'll see. For now I'm just glad that we tracked this one down
quickly.  So what do we do about it?

*Bob*: Simple.  We just turn the right-hand side of the offending
statement into a vector, rather than an array.

*Alice*: But how do you do that?

*Bob*: Ah, when I browsed in the manual, I saw some neat trick.  Just
a moment.  Here it is.  Are you ready for this?  This is good job for
+irb+.  Neat and simple.

    |gravity> irb --prompt short_prompt -r vector.rb
    001:0> a = [1, 2, 3]
    [1, 2, 3]
    002:0> a.class
    Array
    003:0> b = Vector[*a]
    [1, 2, 3]
    004:0> b.class
    Vector

*Alice*: Huh?  How did that work??  What type of magic did you just
invoke, putting a star in front of an array, then wrapping it in
square brackets, and pulling a +Vector+ spell on it?

*Bob*: Another convenient Ruby trick.  It takes a while to learn all
these tricks, but they sure are useful.  Here is what happened.  The
<tt>*</tt> notation in front of an array effectively dissolves the
outer <tt>[]</tt> brackets, turning an array into a comma separated
list of its elements.

*Alice*: Ah, and then you feed that list into the initializer of a new
+Vector+ object.  Very clever, if not devious!

*Bob*: So I'll just cloth the right hand side of the <tt>@pos</tt> and 
<tt>@vel</tt> assignments in <tt>Vector[* ]</tt> garb.  Let me call
this file <tt>euler2b.rb</tt> with +b+ for beta version.  I think
we're getting closer now:

 :inccode: .vbody2.rb+simple_read

And let me try it:

 :commandoutput: ruby euler2b.rb < euler.in

*Alice*: Congratulations!

== A Matter of Taste

*Bob*: Thanks.  So now we have a FORmula TRANslation device
that actually works!

*Alice*: But it is ugly.

*Bob*: I beg your pardon?

*Alice*: It is ugly.

*Bob*: How so?

*Alice*: I don't like those <tt>[*...]</tt> notation.  Looks like a
hack.

*Bob*: I like hacks.

*Alice*: I know you do.  But can't we come up with something cleaner?

*Bob*: Like what?

*Alice*: Well, we have seen that <tt>to_s</tt> will happily turn
something into a string; we even gave our +Body+ class its own
<tt>to_s</tt> method, so that it could show its face in public.  I bet
there is a method called <tt>to_a</tt> that turns objects into arrays.

*Bob*: There is.  And it does just that.

*Alice*: Can't we then write our own <tt>to_v</tt> method which turns
something into a vector?

*Bob*: Now that's a thought.  Sure.  That would be fun!  And I just
know how to do that!  I only have to add a few lines to the
<tt>vector.rb</tt> file.  Here, it is short, let me show the whole file:

 :inccode: vector.rb

== <i>Voila</i>

*Alice*: That's much better.  I don't mind the <tt>[*...}</tt> <i>per se</i>,
it is only that the line with <tt>gets.split.map</tt> followed by a block
of code just got too crowded for comfort.  But your definition of +to_v+
is clean and simple.  So let me check: by writing <tt>class Array</tt>
and so on, you are just extending the Ruby-defined standard array
definition, right?

*Bob*: Right.  Not only can you extend your own classes by giving new
bits and pieces like this, as we have seen before, you can do the same
thing to the predefined classes.  In general, almost nothing in Ruby
is off limits; you can typically treat the built-in stuff as if you
had just written it all yourself.

*Alice*: That's really neat.  So now can we get rid of the clutter
at the bottom of the <tt>vbody.rb</tt> file?

*Bob*: Sure thing.  Here is our +simple_read+, no clutter, and with
the new +to_v+ at the end:  

 :inccode: .vbody.rb+simple_read

*Alice*: Very nice.  And presumably it runs?

*Bob*: I bet you it will!  And to show my confidence, I will call the
file <tt>euler2.rb</tt>, since I think we will be beyond alpha and beta
testing once we see this.

*Alice*: You do sound confident.  Let's see.

 :commandoutput: ruby euler2.rb < euler.in

*Bob*: <i>Voila!</i>

*Alice*: <i>Very</i> good.
