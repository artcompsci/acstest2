Hi Jun and Murat:

I just noticed that we never tested the -x and -i options,
and indeed, not too surprisingly, they did not work.

The -i option was rather easy to repair; it was related to
the fact that we still did not set the end time in a logical
way, for a new era.  I have fixed that now.

The -x option required more thought.  I have just repaired it
now in a rather dirty way, just to get the diagnostics out,	
in case we need to look at acc and jerk.  In doing so, I
violated the DRY principle, but at least everything works now.
When we get the data format worked out, we can clean this up.

Now I *really* plan to stop working this weekend (at least
stop working on acs).  q(^_^)p

Piet
