= Wikib?

One question would be whether or now to use some Web-based
documentation system, such as Wiki or Hiki.

One merit of Wiki-type system is that it offers quite extensive
support for cross-referencing, which current rdoc seem to lack.

To be precise, it is certainly possible to enbed any URL, but it is
not supported to enbed any name tag.
